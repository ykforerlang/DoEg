00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,620
到印度的茂密丛林

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,780
从撒哈拉的沙漠边境
from the edge of the Sahara...

12
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,370
到南极洲的冰冷荒原

13
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,940
我们记录下每个动物家族的关键时期

14
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,590
记录下它们与命运抗争

15
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,610
为生存拼搏
fighting for survival,

16
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,830
既要与自然力量抗衡
against the elements...

17
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,340
又需同竞争对手战斗
and against rivals.

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,650
我们前所未有地从更近距离
We've got closer, and filmed in greater length,

19
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,470
拍摄更长时间

捕捉到更丰富细节

在现代世界  保障下一代的生存

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,120
这里是《动物王朝》
This is Dynasties.

29
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,330
西非  塞内加尔

30
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,280
一群非同寻常的黑猩猩安家于此
Home to a remarkable troupe of chimpanzees.

31
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,940
这里极为炎热干燥
It gets so hot and dry here.

32
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,510
已是它们生存的极限
It's the very limit of where they can survive.

33
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,850
这片领地由一位强壮坚毅的领袖统治
This territory is ruled by one strong and determined leader,

34
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,370
一只名为大卫的雄性首领
an alpha male known as David.

35
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,520
居于统治地位使它尽享一切
His rule gets him the best of everything,

36
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,370
但它谁也不能信任
but he can trust no-one.

37
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,880
周围强敌环伺  时刻准备取而代之
He's surrounded by rivals prepared to kill him for his crown.

38
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,250
这是一个关于权力

39
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,700
政治
politics,

40
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,200
与生存之战的故事

它曾为捍卫地位和家族

44
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,840
身经百战并赢得胜利
to protect his status and his family.

45
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,400
它已领导整个族群三年
He has ruled over his troupe for three years.

46
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,870
通常  首领的在位时间不会比这更长
Leaders here don't usually hold power for much longer than this.

47
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,270
眼下  随着旱季来临
And now, as the dry season begins,

48
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,690
大卫的竞争对手又开始集结
David's rivals are gathering again.

49
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,870
成功的雄性首领
Successful alpha males

50
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,260
通常有许多盟友支持它们
normally have many allies to support them.

51
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,170
但大卫只有它自己
But David is alone.

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,590
它从未像现在这样处于弱势
He has never been more vulnerable.

53
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,460
在旱季  这些大型土丘牢牢吸引着
In the dry season, these huge mounds of earth are magnets

54
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,590
族群里所有三十二只黑猩猩
for all 32 chimps in the group.

55
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,530
这些土丘满藏
The mounds are full of food,

56
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,250
富含脂肪和蛋白质的食物
rich in fat and protein...

57
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,260
白蚁
termites.

58
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,490
这些黑猩猩已学会使用草秆
These chimps have learned to use grass stems

59
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,120
作为工具掏取昆虫
as tools to fish out the insects.

60
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,400
身为首领  大卫可任意选择进食位置
As leader, David gets his pick of the feeding spots.

61
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,970
但它相当谨慎
But he is wary,

62
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,480
因为它必须在宿敌身边进食
as he must feed alongside old enemies.

63
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,520
它有两位极富野心的对手
He has two particularly ambitious rivals.

64
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,440
大卫的脚趾开始抽动
David's toes begin to twitch,

65
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,570
这种紧张抽搐它无法掩饰
a nervous tic he can't conceal.

66
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,000
这是简普金  它对最高权位觊觎已久
This is Jumkin, who has long-sought the top spot.

67
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,140
还有卢瑟
And this, Luthor...

68
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,020
一只暴躁的年轻雄性
a tempestuous younger male

69
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,620
它生性好斗
with an aggressive streak.

70
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,780
几个月来黑猩猩族群第一次聚集
The troupe is together for the first time in months

71
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,640
争夺好的进食位置很容易引发冲突
and jostling for good feeding spots can easily lead to clashes.

72
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,430
此时由大卫出面维持秩序
It's vital that David keeps order,

73
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,040
并化解矛盾显得尤为重要
and defuses the situation.

74
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,340
所有目光都聚焦于它
All eyes are on him.

75
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,520
它的表现宣告一切由他掌控
His display shows he is in control.

76
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,950
但在黑猩猩社会
But in chimp society,

77
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,080
只依靠力量是不够的
strength alone is not enough.

78
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,410
大卫必须用政治手段来巩固权力
David must be political to hold on to power.

79
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,380
它需要结交盟友
He needs to make an ally.

80
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,330
这是卡尔
This is KL.

81
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,690
它很强壮但胡须灰白
He's strong but grey-bearded

82
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,850
已过了争夺领袖地位的年纪
and past the age where he would challenge for the role of alpha.

83
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,340
大卫开始进行试探
David makes an approach.

84
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,280
梳理毛发能建立友谊的纽带
Grooming builds bonds of friendship...

85
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,980
获取支持  并给予回报
buying support and giving benefits in return.

86
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,020
你给我挠背  我也给你挠[互利互惠]
You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours.

87
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,610
只有时间才能证明新的结盟是否成功
Only time will tell if this new alliance will pay off.

88
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,640
气温飙升
Temperatures soar.

89
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,790
已达四十度
It's already 40 degrees.

90
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,870
对幼年黑猩猩来说
The arid land might seem

91
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,130
干燥的大地是供玩耍的巨大沙坑
one giant sandpit for the infants,

92
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,190
但对于成年黑猩猩
but for the adults,

93
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,160
潜伏已久的紧张局势开始浮现
existing tensions are starting to surface.

94
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,940
大卫关注着简普金的动静
And David has his eye on Jumkin.

95
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,790
简普金袭击了一位老年雌性同类
Jumkin attacks an elderly female.

96
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,810
这宣告了它对权力的渴望
It's a display of his aspirations for power.

97
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,870
大卫无法容忍
David can't tolerate this...

98
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,350
而卡尔在此时介入
but KL steps in...

99
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,280
给了简普金一个严厉的教训
..And gives Jumkin a sharp lesson.

100
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:59,450
大卫紧随其后
It's swiftly followed by one from David himself.

101
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,100
随着最后一个猛扑
With a final, huge lunge at his rival...

102
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,620
简普金砰然倒地
...Jumkin comes crashing down.

103
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,170
大卫和卡尔联手起来
Together, David and KL are now

104
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,650
是一股不可小觑的力量
a force to be reckoned with.

105
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:46,060
大火摧毁了族群四分之三的领地
Fires destroy three quarters of the group's territory.

106
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,540
它们大部分的食物和住所都不复存在
Much of their food and shelter has gone.

107
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,780
随着气温继续升高
And with temperatures continuing to rise,

108
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,520
水愈发稀缺
water is becoming perilously scarce.

109
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,380
族群必须团结一致才能生存下去
The group must stick together to survive.

110
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,090
聚集在干涸的河床上
Gathering in a dried out riverbed,

111
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,400
它们运用代代相传的智慧
they use knowledge passed down from generation to generation.

112
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,160
焦土之下有一处隐藏的水源
A hidden water source under the parched earth.

113
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,740
对大卫来说  干旱不是唯一的问题
For David, there is more than just drought to worry about.

114
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,820
它无法避开它的对手
He can't avoid his rivals.

115
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,160
卡尔成了大卫的忠实盟友
KL is proving to be a loyal ally to David.

116
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,830
此刻大卫无比需要卡尔的支持
And David is going to need him more than ever.

117
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:02,090
极其罕见地  七只雌性黑猩猩中的三只
By rare coincidence, three of the seven females

118
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,970
同时进入发情期
have become sexually receptive at the same time.

119
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,580
它们肿胀的生殖器吸引着所有雄性黑猩猩
Their swellings attract the attention of all the males.

120
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,430
雌性会尽可能多地与不同的雄性交配
The females will try to mate with as many males as possible.

121
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,460
大卫必须控制它们
David must control them all

122
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,650
确保自己是唯一的交配对象
to ensure he is the one who mates.

123
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,650
但有些成员  比如卢瑟  却另有打算
But some of the troupe, like Luthor, have other ideas.

124
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,690
所有雄性猩猩都将此视为它们的机会
All the other males see this could be their chance.

125
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,870
此刻对大卫来说  捍卫自己的权利
There's never been a more important moment for David

126
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,730
至关重要
to assert his power.

127
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,980
它首先发起攻击
He makes the first move.

128
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,970
而对手们亦通过展示自己的力量来回应
His rivals respond with their own display of strength

129
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,180
他们开始团结一致
and start to close ranks.

130
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,370
大卫和卡尔似乎寡不敌众
David and KL seemed to be outnumbered.

131
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,420
局面陷入一片混乱
Everything turns to chaos.

132
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,650
夜晚某时
At some point during the night,

133
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,670
年轻的雄性猩猩向大卫发起了攻击
the younger males turned on David.

134
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:29,790
雌性猩猩和它们的幼崽来到它身边
The females and their infants come to his side

135
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,970
支持它  照料它的伤势
to support him and tend his wounds.

136
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,320
它们不能留在这
They can't stay here.

137
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,010
它们和幼崽需要水源
They and their young need water.

138
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,240
整个族群将迁移到距离最近的水坑
The whole group move on to the nearest water hole.

139
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,830
卡尔也不得不离开大卫
Even KL has to leave David behind.

140
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,690
距离下个水源地要跋涉十公里
It's a six mile trek to the next source of water.

141
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,540
大卫被留下等死
David is left for dead.

142
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,070
首领位置出现空缺
There is now a power vacuum at the top

143
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:47,670
卢瑟视此为良机
and Luthor sees an opportunity.

144
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:28,170
在族群中制造恐惧是成为首领的途径之一
Creating fear within the group is one way to become leader.

145
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,510
它试图恫吓族群
He tries to intimidate the group,

146
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,310
但争夺首领之位从不是一蹴而就
but a bid for leadership is never instant.

147
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,200
它必须坚持作势数日
He'll have to keep this up for many days.

148
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,290
无依无靠  伤痕累累
Friendless and wounded,

149
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,550
大卫仍然振作起来寻找食物
David somehow musters the energy to search for food.

150
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,740
在被彻底流放前它必须回到族群中去
He has to rejoined the group before he's exiled for good.

151
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:51,170
但首先  它得恢复体力
But first, he must regain strength.

152
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,350
剩下的时间已不多
Time is running out.

153
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,200
令人惊叹的是  攻击发生后一周
Remarkably, one week after the attack,

154
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,730
大卫踏上搜寻族群的长途跋涉
David makes the long journey to find the group.

155
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,680
与此同时  卢瑟
Luthor, meanwhile,

156
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,380
逐渐提升了自己的领导地位
has ramped up his bid for leadership.

157
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,630
大卫还差一步
David has almost made it...

158
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,480
但此时它已无力再战
..But he's in no fit state to fight.

159
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,200
卢瑟发现了大卫
Luthor spots David's approach...

160
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,990
随时准备应战
..and readies himself for battle.

161
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,840
面对卢瑟  大卫唯一的机会
David's only chance against Luthor

162
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,470
就是尽量使自己看起来强大
is to make himself look as strong as possible.

163
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:33,210
心生胆怯  卢瑟只得逃跑
Intimidated, Luthor has to run.

164
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,170
没有使出一招一式
Without a blow being struck,

165
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,000
大卫凯旋归来
David is back!

166
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:23,340
大卫终于和战友卡尔重聚
David is finally reunited with his comrade, KL.

167
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:58,660
它们为彼此梳理毛发以加强友谊的纽带
Grooming each other reaffirms their bonds of friendship.

168
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,400
对大卫来说  回归只是成功的一半
For David, returning is only half the battle.

169
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,810
负伤疲惫的它
Exhausted and fragile,

170
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:00,440
在族群中的地位岌岌可危
he's only hanging on to his leadership by a thread.

171
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,440
卢瑟似乎认输了
Luthor appears defeated.

172
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,870
它采取顺从的姿态
With a submissive gesture,

173
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:28,680
希望得到大卫的原谅
he seeks forgiveness from David.

174
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,930
但大卫不愿接受
But David is unwilling to accept.

175
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:27,200
接下来的几周  卢瑟发现自己被排挤了
Over the following weeks, Luthor finds himself sidelined.

176
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,010
其它的雄性猩猩如今聚集在大卫身边
The other males now gather around David.

177
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,140
卢瑟别无选择  只能俯首顺从
And Luthor has no choice but to step in line.

178
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,950
大卫重新登上了族群首领的位置
David has his group around him once more,

179
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,080
但它没有对外暴露自己的羸弱
but he doesn't show them how weakened he really is.

180
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,040
它的伤口还未愈合
His injuries haven't healed

181
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,760
其它雄性猩猩随时可能再次发起攻击
and the males could turn on him again at any moment.

182
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,840
但此刻  它还能骗过大家
For now, he seems to be fooling them all.

183
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,330
它争分夺秒地重拾往日力量
He's buying himself time to regain his strength

184
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,380
希望在下一只雌性猩猩发情前恢复体力
before another female comes into season

185
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,940
因为那时它又将面临挑战
when he will face competition once again.

186
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:20,600
终于  饱含雨水的云层
At last, rain-filled clouds

187
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,010
结束了干旱
bring an end to the drought.

188
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:04,130
大卫的领地重焕新生
David's territory is transformed.

189
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,830
水源充沛
There is water everywhere

190
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,720
食物充盈
and a glut of food.

191
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:28,130
族群的生存压力减轻了
The pressure on the group is lifted.

192
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:37,600
在经历了数月的艰辛之后
Everyone can relax a little

193
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,080
大家都可以放松一些
after months of hardship.

194
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,650
大卫的身体又强壮起来
David's strength appears to be returning.

195
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:55,130
它在族群面前越来越果断自信
His displays in front of the group become ever more assertive.

196
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,730
但实际上
But in truth,

197
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:17,620
它比表现出来的样子要虚弱
he remains weaker than he lets on to the others.

198
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:34,680
一有机会它就会消失去收集额外的食物
Whenever possible, he disappears to gather extra food.

199
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,360
找到什么吃什么
He gorges on everything he can find...

200
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,840
水果
Fruit...

201
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,330
树叶
Leaves...

202
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,610
甚至蚂蚁
Even ants.

203
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,620
它基本恢复健康了
He's almost back to full health.

204
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,770
但只是这样还不足以帮助它
But that alone might still not be enough for him

205
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:31,520
握紧权利
to hold on to power.

206
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:36,240
很快又有雌性黑猩猩准备好要交配
Soon, another female will be ready to mate.

207
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:55,000
上一次  一位盟友对大卫来说显然不够
Last time, one ally was not enough for David.

208
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,080
它要尝试新策略
He tries a new strategy.

209
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:15,040
它开始给其他雄性黑猩猩梳毛
He starts grooming other males.

210
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,240
一开始一位
First one...

211
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,530
然后另一个
Then another.

212
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:53,140
慢慢地几周过去后  它的身边逐渐
Slowly, over weeks, he surrounds himself

213
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,610
聚集起一群支持者
with a band of allies.

214
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,390
一支由年长黑猩猩组成的军队
An army of elders...

215
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,980
都是打架老手
Experienced fighters,

216
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,690
但又太老  不足以篡权
but too old to steal his crown.

217
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,090
现在它只能静待  看它采取的措施
Now, he must wait and see if he's done enough

218
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:23,240
是否能够阻止下一次的阶级挑战
to prevent a recurrence of dissent in the ranks.

219
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:36,060
果然没多久就有一只雌性进入交配季
Sure enough, a female has come into season.

220
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:44,310
它肿胀的生殖器让人难以不加注意
Her swelling doesn't go unnoticed.

221
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,410
上一次  大卫处于弱势
Last time, David was vulnerable.

222
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,820
这一次它有了众多同盟
This time, he has allies...

223
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:36,070
时刻准备着冲锋在前  为它理清道路
Prepared to charge ahead and clear his path.

224
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,370
大卫展示着自己的力量
Displaying his strength

225
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,820
提醒它的对手最好离远一点
reminds rivals to stay away.

226
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,000
如果大卫作为头领足以服众
If David has fully secured his position as Alpha,

227
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,970
那么它将是与那只雌性交配的黑猩猩
he will be the one who mates with the female.

228
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:32,860
它俩眼神交接
She catches his eye.

229
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:50,010
在一众同盟者分散就位后
With a number of allies positioned throughout the group,

230
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,160
没有胆敢挑战它的敌人
none of his rivals dare to challenge him.

231
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:59,800
轮到大卫交配了
This is David's time to mate.

232
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:02,310
九个月后
Nine months later...

233
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,910
一只雄性幼崽诞生了
A new baby boy!

234
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:25,560
这是大卫成功捍卫领导权的奖励
David's reward for maintaining power.

235
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:38,900
它的统治和它的王朝得以延续
His rule and the future of his dynasty is secure.

236
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:51,850
作为头领  大卫将有比族群里
By being Alpha, David will have sired

237
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:55,960
其它雄性多一倍的后代诞生
twice as many offspring as any other member of the group.

238
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:04,400
未来某天  它的某个儿子也许有本事
And one day, one of his sons might just have what it takes

239
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,590
能成为下一位头领
to be a future leader.

240
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:21,610
大卫是这个黑猩猩族群里最强大
David has become the most powerful, longest reigning alpha,

241
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,050
统治时间最久的头领
this group has ever seen.

242
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:30,940
但永远会有下一个旱季的到来
But there will always be another dry season,

243
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:35,230
永远会有对手
and there will always be rivals

244
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,790
在静静等待它们的机会
waiting for their chance.
