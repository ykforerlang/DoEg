4
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,330
狮子是王权的象征
Lions are the very image of majesty.

5
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,620
也是非洲的形象代表
And, indeed, of Africa itself.

6
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,590
它们的力量来自于狮群的强大
Their strength lies in the power of the pride,

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,060
紧密团结的家族
their tight-knit family.

8
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,200
狮子已统治大草原数千年
Lions have ruled the savannahs for millennia.

9
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,590
然而  最近二十年左右
And yet, within the last 20 years or so,

10
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,110
它们的数量减少了将近一半
their numbers have fallen by almost half.

11
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,130
我们的团队用了两年时间
Our team has spent two years following

12
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,680
追踪肯尼亚马赛马拉的玛莎狮群
perhaps the most famous lion family of all,

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,170
这也许是最有名的狮子家族
the Marsh pride of Kenya's Masai Mara.

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,060
我们加入时  这个伟大王朝的生存
As we join them, the very survival of this great dynasty

15
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,620
已危在旦夕
is under threat.

16
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,370
它们的未来完全依仗于
Their future depends entirely

17
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,860
一位超凡领袖的
on the strength and determination

18
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,810
力量与决心
of one extraordinary leader.

19
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,340
它也许是玛莎狮群历史上
Perhaps the most powerful in the history

20
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,540
最为强大的首领
of the Marsh pride.

21
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,640
这头母狮名叫沙尔姆
A lioness known as Charm.

22
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,850
狮子

23
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,820
马赛马拉
The Masai Mara.

24
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,790
狮群在这里蓬勃繁衍
The pride have always thrived here

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,330
靠的是强壮的首领公狮
through an alliance between powerful alpha males

26
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,120
保护家族
to protect the family

27
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,590
经验丰富的母狮抚育幼崽
and experienced females to raise the cubs.

28
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,300
然而  玛莎狮群史上首次
But, for the first time in the pride's history,

29
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,800
这种狮群成员间的合作破裂
this alliance has been shattered.

30
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,220
所有的成年公狮抛弃了家族
The family has been abandoned by all the adult males.

31
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,690
狮群的存亡落在了沙尔姆
The survival of the pride now rests upon the shoulders of Charm

32
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,460
还有它的同族姐妹西恩娜肩上
and her cousin, Sienna.

33
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,310
仅剩的两头成年狮子
The only remaining adults.

34
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,810
若希望幼狮长大成年
If their young are to reach adulthood

35
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,330
王朝重回鼎盛
and the dynasty return to full strength,

36
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,070
它们必须担起保护与喂养全家的双重责任
they must now both protect and feed the whole family.

37
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,690
八月
August.

38
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,490
几场雨后  食物充裕的时期到来
Following the recent rains, it's a time of plenty.

39
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,810
狮子周围到处都是牛羚
The lions are surrounded by wildebeest

40
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,870
它们正在年度迁徙途中
on their annual migration.

41
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,940
一头二百五十千克的公牛可以让
A quarter-tonne bull would make a good meal

42
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,270
狮群的十头狮子饱餐一顿
for all ten of the pride.

43
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,470
但尽管沙尔姆是一位经验丰富的猎手
But even though Charm is an experienced hunter,

44
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,250
多数尝试都以失败告终
most attempts end in failure.

45
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,750
沙尔姆用后腿蹬踹  使牛羚失去平衡
Charm uses her hind legs to knock the wildebeest off-balance.

46
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,000
最小的幼崽在未来的十二个月内
The smallest cubs won't be able to catch food for themselves

47
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,080
尚无能力自己捕食
for another 12 months.

48
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,100
它们的胃口渐长  意味着沙尔姆和西恩娜
Their ever-growing appetites mean that Charm and Sienna

49
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,640
必须夜以继日地捕猎
have to hunt around the clock.

50
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,520
母狮经常被迫独自出行
The females are often forced to head out alone.

51
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,230
今晚  轮到西恩娜捕猎
Tonight, it's Sienna's turn.

52
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,220
日出时分
Sunrise.

53
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,090
西恩娜身受重伤
Sienna is seriously injured.

54
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,920
它虚弱到无法移动
She's too week to move.

55
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:12,420
一头落单的狮子很容易受到野牛
A lone lion is always at risk of attack by buffalo,

56
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,500
鬣狗  甚至其它狮群的攻击
hyenas, even other lion prides.

57
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,510
日落时分
It's evening,

58
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,620
西恩娜仍然没有回到家人身边
and Sienna hasn't returned to her family.

59
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,480
如今  一切都要靠沙尔姆了
Now, everything depends on Charm.

60
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,550
夜幕降临
As night falls,

61
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,080
沙尔姆别无选择  只能独自出发捕猎
Charm has no choice but to head out to hunt,

62
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,870
留下脆弱的幼崽
leaving the vulnerable cubs alone.

63
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,860
它被尾随了
She's being trailed.

64
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,170
是鬣狗
Hyenas.

65
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,340
一旦得到机会  它们会攻击落单的狮子
They'll attack lone lions if they get the chance,

66
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,630
将它们的猎物占为己有
to steal any kill they make.

67
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,940
沙尔姆必须在被它们找到之前快速动手
Charm must work fast before they find her.

68
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,820
它们追踪到了它
They've tracked her down.

69
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,020
仅靠自己  它无法抵御它们
On her own, she couldn't hold them off.

70
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,020
不过  狮群的另一位成员一直跟着沙尔姆
But another of the pride has been following Charm.

71
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,400
它三岁的女儿  雅雅
Her three-year-old daughter, Yaya.

72
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,360
狮群的其它成员赶到
The rest of the pride arrive.

73
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,060
来进食
To eat.

74
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,700
雅雅挺身而出保护狮群
Yaya has stepped up to help defend the pride

75
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,470
并供养家族
and feed her family.

76
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,450
女儿终生留在母亲身边
Daughters stay with their mothers for life,

77
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,510
最终也许会有自己的幼崽
and may eventually have cubs of their own.

78
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,160
雅雅还未成年  但作为沙尔姆的大女儿
Yaya is not yet an adult, but as Charm's eldest daughter,

79
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,680
它是狮群首领的继任者
she's next in line to lead the pride.

80
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,700
沙尔姆还有一个三岁的儿子  塔图
Charm also has a three-year-old son, Tatu.

81
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,300
开始长出引人瞩目的鬃毛
The beginnings of an impressive mane are a sign

82
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,480
是它接近成年的标志
of his approaching adulthood.

83
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,290
像每个青少年一样
Like every adolescent,

84
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,020
塔图一有机会
Tatu can't resist the chance

85
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,250
就想测试自己日渐增长的力量
to test his growing strength.

86
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,170
甚至去挑衅一头两吨重的河马
Even against a two-tonne hippo.

87
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,890
不过它并非狮群中唯一的年轻雄狮
But he's not the only young male in this pride.

88
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,680
它的同族兄弟  雷德
His cousin, Red.

89
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,820
过去几个月间  它们之间
Over the last few months, the two of them have begun

90
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,830
开始建立同盟
to forge an alliance.

91
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,950
但即使一起行动  它们还是奈何不了
But even together, they're not really going to worry

92
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,570
一头发怒的河马
an angry hippo.

93
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,060
和姐妹们不同  儿子长大后
Unlike their sisters, sons always leave their family

94
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,150
总是会离开家族
when they reach adulthood.

95
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,830
它们之间渐强的情感纽带
Their growing bond

96
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,610
或许能让它们强强联手  结伴离开
may enable them to leave as a powerful partnership.

97
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,690
最终  它们会与其它公狮作战
Eventually, they'll fight other males

98
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,750
尝试统领自己的狮群
to try and take over a pride of their own.

99
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,880
但是眼下  它们仍然需要
But for the time being, they still need Charm

100
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,440
沙尔姆的照顾
to look after them.

101
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,550
距西恩娜被攻击已过去四天
It's been four days since Sienna was attacked.

102
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,810
它爬起身来
She's back on her feet.

103
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,510
但它急需进食
But she's in urgent need of a meal.

104
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,900
它实在没有足够的力气
She simply doesn't have the strength.

105
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,710
随着它们逐渐成熟  年轻的公狮
As they mature, young males begin to

106
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,350
开始探索狮群领地的边界
explore the boundaries of the pride's territory.

107
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,090
雷德独自出来探险
Red has ventured out alone.

108
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:07,430
它冒失地闯入一群鬣狗之中
And blundered straight into the middle of the hyena clan.

109
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,430
它被二十多条鬣狗困住了
He's trapped by over 20 of them.

110
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,360
鬣狗群试图拖垮它
The pack tries to wear him down.

111
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,730
这么多鬣狗足以杀死它
This number of hyenas could kill him.

112
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,740
同时对抗所有的鬣狗根本不可能
It's impossible to fight them all at once.

113
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,450
它无法跟它们对峙太久
He can't keep them at bay for much longer.

114
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,110
它在迅速衰弱
He's tiring fast.

115
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,940
它的盟友塔图听到骚动
His ally, Tatu, has heard the commotion.

116
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,230
现在局势逆转
Now, the odds have changed.

117
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,140
即使是二十条鬣狗
Even for 20 hyenas,

118
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:35,220
也无法对抗两头公狮
a pair of male lions is too much to take on.

119
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,660
雷德很幸运
Red is lucky.

120
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,670
塔图救了同族兄弟的命
Tatu has saved his cousin's life.

121
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,680
数周来西恩娜靠零碎食物果腹
After weeks of feeding on scraps,

122
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,350
现在它终于有力气去与家族重聚
Sienna has grown strong enough to try and rejoin her family.

123
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,920
它先向沙尔姆问候
She greets Charm first.

124
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,180
即使分开这么久
Even after being apart for so long,

125
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,560
它们之间的情感纽带依然坚固
the bond between them is still strong.

126
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,280
雅雅也欢迎西恩娜重回狮群
Yaya also welcomes Sienna back into the pride.

127
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,190
沙尔姆的家族终于团圆
At last, Charm's family are back together.

128
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,660
沙尔姆不但重获捕猎伙伴
Charm not only has her hunting partner back,

129
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,100
另一位猎手也成长起来
but another hunter is emerging.

130
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,030
雅雅正逐渐长成一头强壮的母狮
Yaya is becoming a powerful lioness.

131
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,800
它已学会如何潜行
She's learned how to stalk.

132
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,620
身体放低
Stay low.

133
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,560
悄无声息地
Approach silently.

134
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,760
逆风接近
And from downwind.

135
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:31,170
但是成功伏击的关键是不被发现
But the key to a successful ambush is not being noticed.

136
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,610
一旦被发现
Now it's seen her,

137
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,470
头顶尖角的牛羚更占上风
the wildebeest, with its sharp horns, has the advantage.

138
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,470
不过雅雅在学习中进步
But Yaya is learning.

139
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,780
母女之间逐渐建立伙伴关系
Mother and daughter are starting to develop their partnership.

140
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,260
时值十月
It's October.

141
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,270
牛羚的大迁徙永不停歇
The great wildebeest migration never stops.

142
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,160
现在它们要离开马赛马拉
And now, they're leaving the Masai Mara.

143
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:13,190
对沙尔姆和它的家族来说
For Charm and her family,

144
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,360
获取食物将变得更加困难
food is about to become much more difficult to find.

145
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,720
草原现在空空荡荡
The plains are now empty.

146
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,630
为了寻找食物
And, in search of food,

147
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,780
沙尔姆带领狮群来到领地的边缘
Charm leads the pride to the edge of their range.

148
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,760
它在这里找到另一种猎物
Here, she finds another kind of prey.

149
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:14,360
被非法带入狮群领地放牧的牛
Cattle, illegally brought into the lions' territory to graze.

150
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,570
猎牛是喂饱它饥饿家族的机会
An opportunity to feed her hungry family.

151
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,020
但也可能招致灾难
But hunting cattle can lead to disaster.

152
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,200
为了保护牲畜
To protect their livestock,

153
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,680
牧民有时会布设毒饵
herdsmen sometimes put out poisoned bait.

154
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,980
狮子无法判断食物是否有毒
Lions can't tell when a meal is toxic.

155
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,900
一周后
A week later,

156
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:11,030
沙尔姆一岁的儿子  已经病得爬不起来
Charm's one-year-old son is so ill he can hardly stand.

157
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,000
整个狮群都显现出中毒症状
The whole pride are showing the signs of poisoning.

158
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,990
而西恩娜再次失踪了
And Sienna is missing once again.

159
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:39,780
随着温度的上升  狮群出发寻找阴凉处
As the temperature climbs, the pride heads off to find shade.

160
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,940
但是痛苦的幼狮虚弱得无法跟上
But the struggling cub is too weak to follow.

161
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,290
沙尔姆需要和狮群待在一起
Charm needs to stay with the rest of the pride.

162
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,310
几小时后  幼狮还是没有追上妈妈
Hours later, the cub still hasn't caught up with his mother.

163
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,010
而西恩娜也不见踪影
And there's no sign of Sienna, either.

164
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:24,860
第二天  沙尔姆回到儿子身边
The next day, Charm returns to her son's side.

165
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,580
它仍然步履蹒跚
He's still very unsteady.

166
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,760
但是它的妈妈不能弃狮群于不顾
But his mother can't abandon the rest of the pride.

167
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:19,620
为了狮群  沙尔姆抛弃它的幼子
For the sake of the pride, charm abandons her young cub.

168
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,950
其它狮群成员在等它
The others are waiting for her.

169
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,030
它们前所未有地需要它
They need her now more than ever.

170
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,250
它再也不会见到活着的儿子
She will never see her son, or Sienna,

171
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,350
或是西恩娜
alive again.

172
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:01,150
尽管失去亲人  沙尔姆和它的王朝
Despite her losses, there may still be a future

173
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,660
仍有未来的希望
for Charm and her dynasty.

174
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,580
它最大的孩子  雅雅和塔图
Her eldest cubs, Yaya and Tatu,

175
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,800
从中毒中幸存下来
have survived the poisoning.

176
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:47,320
沙尔姆带领狮群不断迁移  寻找猎物
Charm keeps the pride moving in a constant search for prey.

177
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,930
即使有雅雅的帮助
Catching enough food is hard,

178
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,680
捕获足够的猎物仍然很难
even with Yaya's help.

179
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,110
但沙尔姆绝不放弃
But Charm is relentless.

180
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:44,130
狮群里的年轻成员也努力向它学习
The younger members of the pride try to follow her example.

181
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:05,550
虽然猎物稀少  鬣狗又不断骚扰
Even with little to hunt and the constant harassment of hyenas,

182
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,840
沙尔姆作为领袖的技能和经验
Charm's skill and experience as a leader

183
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:11,200
让狮群得以存活
is keeping the pride alive.

184
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:25,150
几周后  它的努力开始收到回报
A few weeks later, her efforts begin to be rewarded.

185
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:33,650
塔图和雷德已经超过四岁
Tatu and Red are now over four years old,

186
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:37,380
准备好迈出成年的最后一步
ready to take the final step to adulthood.

187
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,050
它们该离开狮群了
It's time for them to leave the pride.

188
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,500
对沙尔姆来说  这就是成功
For Charm, this is success.

189
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,510
它们结伴离开  并肩与其它公狮作战
They head out as a partnership, to battle other males,

190
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,540
争取属于自己的狮群
to win a pride of their own,

191
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,590
并在别处延续家族血脉
and continue the family's bloodline elsewhere.

192
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,040
但是沙尔姆仍需照顾剩下的四头母狮
But Charm still needs to get the remaining four female cubs

193
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,130
安全长至成年
safely to adulthood.

194
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,190
五月的一个清晨
One early morning in May...

195
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,950
成年公狮的吼叫
..The roar of adult male lions.

196
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,640
两头外来的新公狮
Two new males, outsiders,

197
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,020
在寻找可以统领的狮群
are searching for a pride to take over as their own.

198
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,160
新的公狮可以带来养育
New males could bring the possibility

199
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,840
新一代幼崽的可能性
of a new generation of cubs.

200
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,350
但它们也同样可以轻易带来灾难
But they could just as easily bring disaster.

201
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:23,430
不久  新的公狮开始
Soon, the new males begin to impose their authority

202
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,170
向玛莎狮群施加压力
on the Marsh pride.

203
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:31,150
沙尔姆的小女儿还没到繁殖年龄
Charm's youngest daughter is still too young to breed.

204
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,400
对于雄狮来说  它只不过是又一只
To the males, she's nothing more than another mouth

205
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,120
分享食物的同类
to share food with.

206
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,840
它们不想让它留在自己的狮群
They don't want her in their pride.

207
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,920
沙尔姆尽可能地努力保护女儿
Try as she might, Charm struggles to defend her daughter.

208
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:10,930
即使它也无法与成年雄狮相匹敌
Even she is no match for an adult male.

209
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,790
沙尔姆试着分散它们的注意
Charm tries distracting them,

210
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,240
用自己的身体挡在幼崽前
putting herself between them and her cub.

211
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,660
但是这没有用
But it's no good.

212
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,320
如果它女儿留下  最终会死于雄狮口下
If her daughter stays, the males will eventually kill her.

213
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:51,360
幼狮除了离开别无选择
The cub has no choice but to leave.

214
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,420
雄狮并不满足于此
And the males don't stop there.

215
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,510
所有幼狮都被驱逐
Every young cub is driven out.

216
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,670
它们前途未卜
Their future is uncertain.

217
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,420
沙尔姆对此无能为力
There's nothing Charm can do.

218
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,090
八个月前
Eight months ago,

219
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:40,360
沙尔姆的狮群有十头狮子
Charm's pride numbered ten lions.

220
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:45,880
现在只剩下它和雅雅
Of them, only she and Yaya now remain.

221
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:36,530
最终  角马群的回归标志着艰难时期
The return of the wildebeest signals the end, at last,

222
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,650
终于结束
of the hard times.

223
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:54,290
是时候重新开始了
Time for a new beginning.

224
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,390
沙尔姆正开始
Charm is starting the process

225
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:11,610
重建玛莎狮群
of rebuilding the Marsh pride.

226
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,510
它和一只雄狮远离了
She and one of the males have separated themselves

227
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,410
狮群其它成员
from the rest of the group.

228
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:32,600
雌狮每过几个月
Females are only able to conceive

229
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,300
才能受孕一次
once every few months.

230
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:41,890
在那些重要的日子  雄狮会一直在它身边
For those crucial days, the male won't leave her side.

231
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,930
沙尔姆离雄狮很近
Charm stays close to him

232
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,360
以稳固它们的感情纽带
to strengthen their bond.

233
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:19,320
如果雄狮无法确定未来的幼崽是它的孩子
If the male isn't certain any future cubs are his,

234
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,630
它可能会杀死它们
he will probably kill them.

235
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,720
四个月过去了
Four months later.

236
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:02,510
沙尔姆远离狮群  独自生活
Charm is alone, away from the pride.

237
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,240
在过去的十四个月中
Over the last 14 months,

238
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,180
它的王朝面临毁灭
her dynasty has faced ruin.

239
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,340
但现在  新的希望诞生
But now, there is new hope.

240
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,920
只有两周大
Just two weeks old.

241
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,610
沙尔姆远离狮群生下幼崽
Charm gave birth away from the others.

242
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,420
过分好奇而笨手笨脚的狮子
Inquisitive and clumsy lions

243
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:05,510
对新生幼崽可能造成威胁
could be a threat to the newborns.

244
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:12,830
但沙尔姆的两只幼崽依然极度脆弱
But her two cubs are still extremely vulnerable.

245
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,520
水牛群搜寻狮子幼崽
Buffaloes seek out lion cubs

246
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,760
有机会时会杀死它们
and will kill them if they get the chance.

247
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,700
沙尔姆用身体护卫着幼崽
She shields them with her body.

248
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,920
没有它的保护
Without her to protect them,

249
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,540
水牛会把幼崽们踩死
the buffalo will trample them to death.

250
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,260
沙尔姆迫使整个水牛群打退堂鼓
Charm has forced the entire herd to back down.

251
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:44,800
对于狮子幼崽  危险无处不在
Life is always dangerous for lion cubs.

252
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:46,180
但这两只幼崽
But these two

253
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,900
有一位经验丰富的母亲照顾它们

254
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:58,780
最终  沙尔姆的狮群得以再次壮大
At last, Charm's pride is increasing again.

255
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:47,150
一只雄狮和一只雌狮
One male and one female.

256
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:55,400
这些幼崽也许很快就会有新的伙伴
And these cubs may soon be joined by more.

257
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:15,660
雅雅和另一只成年雄狮组成配对
Yaya has paired off with the other adult male.

258
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:26,130
很快  它也会有孩子
Soon, she too will have cubs.

259
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,920
沙尔姆的孙辈
Charm's grandchildren.

260
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:57,020
沙尔姆正第一次带它的幼崽
Charm is taking her cubs to meet

261
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:01,210
去见玛莎狮群的其它成员
the rest of the Marsh pride for the first time.

262
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,830
它们的父亲一旦接受幼崽
Once their father has accepted the cubs,

263
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:12,050
就会像它们的母亲一样拼命保护它们
he'll defend them as fiercely as their mother.

264
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:25,850
它们也代表着它的王朝的未来
They are the future of his dynasty, too.

265
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:36,430
沙尔姆自从生产就远离狮群
Charm has been away from the pride since giving birth,

266
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:39,070
已有几周没见过雅雅
and hasn't seen Yaya for weeks.

267
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,770
它们之间的纽带撑过了这个狮群
Their bond has held through perhaps the hardest times

268
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:50,990
史上最艰难的时光
in the pride's history.

269
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,950
它的女儿也已孕育幼崽
With her daughter pregnant

270
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,950
它的儿子亦踏上寻找自己狮群之路
and her son looking for a pride of his own,

271
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,230
沙尔姆的王朝和玛莎狮群
Charm's dynasty and the Marsh pride

272
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,240
得以存续
will live on.

273
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:14,850
这头非凡的雌狮获得了成功
This extraordinary lioness has succeeded.
