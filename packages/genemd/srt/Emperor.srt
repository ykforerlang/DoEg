3
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,970
南极洲  阿特卡湾的秋天
Autumn in Atka Bay, Antarctica.

4
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,920
几周前  这里还是一片海阔天空
Just a few weeks ago, this was open sea.

5
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,410
如今  正在形成冰封雪盖的新景象
Now, a new frozen landscape is forming.

6
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,830
毫无生机的新世界出现了
This new world appears devoid of life.

7
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,040
也并不是全无生机
Well, almost.

8
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,160
一只皇帝企鹅
An emperor penguin.

9
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,580
它并非孑然一身
And he is not alone.

10
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,310
数千只帝企鹅正向这处冰冻的海湾汇集
Thousands of emperors are coming to this frozen bay.

11
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,250
新结成的冰层
They are here because the new ice

12
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,900
为它们提供了最安全的繁殖地
provides the safest place for them to breed.

13
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,150
冰层会保持冰封九个月
The ice will last nine months,

14
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,510
直到夏季来临时融化
before melting away next summer.

15
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,380
它们将利用这九个月中的每一天
And they will need every day of those nine months

16
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,350
来抚育伟大帝企鹅王朝的后代
to raise the next generation of this great emperor dynasty.

17
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,890
但要做到这一点
But to do so,

18
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,930
它们必须熬过即将来临的冬季
they will have to survive the coming winter.

19
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,790
地球上最冷  最残酷的
The coldest and the cruellest

20
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,910
冬季
on earth.

22
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,760
帝企鹅每年都会重新择偶
Emperors pair up anew every year...

23
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,780
尽管冬季即将来临
And although winter is fast approaching,

24
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,630
寻找完美伴侣的过程
the process of finding the perfect partner

25
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,360
却不能操之过急
cannot be hurried.

26
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,670
新结成的企鹅夫妻会进行优雅的仪式
New couples perform a graceful ritual

27
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,380
来巩固对彼此的承诺
that will cement their commitment to each other.

28
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,200
保持动作同步
Moving together in synchrony

29
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,000
是建立有力情感纽带的关键
is the key to creating a powerful bond.

30
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,270
这必须成为自然界中最牢固的纽带之一
And this bond needs to be one of the strongest in nature...

31
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,520
因为这里每个家庭的存亡
Because the survival of every family here,

32
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,000
以及整个王朝的延续
and therefore the survival of this dynasty,

33
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,620
都取决于这一纽带
depends upon it.

34
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,060
企鹅的身体构造使其能完美应对很多事
A penguin is beautifully designed for many things...

35
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,340
但交配却不是其中之一
But mating is not one of them.

36
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,590
遗憾的是  不是所有企鹅
Unfortunately, not all the penguins

37
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,690
都能找到完美的伴侣
have been able to find the perfect partner.

38
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,830
随着时光飞逝
And, with time fast running out,

39
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,160
这只雌性企鹅不再遵守礼仪
this female forgoes the formalities.

40
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,080
但这对企鹅已经形成坚固的纽带
But this couple has already bonded too tightly

41
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,120
第三者无法将它们拆散
to be split apart by an interloper.

42
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,520
找不到伴侣的企鹅
Penguins unlucky in love

43
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,650
会折回大海觅食  度过这个冬季
head back to spend the winter feeding at sea,

44
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,550
因为冰层上没有食物
because there's no food out here on the ice.

45
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,700
企鹅蛋发育期间
The couples now face weeks of waiting

46
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,880
企鹅夫妻们必须等待数周
while their eggs develop.

47
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,440
但这对企鹅似乎进度超前
But one pair appears to have got ahead of schedule.

48
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,720
企鹅腹部凸起一块
A bulge on a penguin's belly

49
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,770
一般是父母一方把蛋放在脚上保暖的迹象
is normally the sign of a parent keeping an egg warm on its feet.

50
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,760
但它看起来像在
But she seems to be trying to keep

51
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,690
给一个雪球保暖
a snowball warm.

52
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,570
看来它们在为照顾真的企鹅蛋做练习
They appear to be getting in some practice for the real thing.

53
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,370
白昼越来越短  也越来越冷
The days are becoming shorter and colder...

54
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,490
终于
Until finally,

55
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:47,060
太阳最后一次落下  两个月的极夜开始
the sun sets for the last time for two months.

56
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,480
春季来临前太阳都不会升起
It won't rise again until the spring.

57
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,710
在南极洲的月光下
Now, they live in a twilight world,

58
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,450
它们生活在暮色之中
under the bright Antarctic moon.

59
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,210
对于这对企鹅  漫长的等待即将结束
For this couple, the long wait for their egg is almost over.

60
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,600
企鹅妈妈感觉到了
The female senses it.

61
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,440
它的宫缩开始了
Her contractions have begun.

62
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,070
下一代帝企鹅即将诞生
The next generation of emperors is on its way.

63
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,470
育成一枚企鹅蛋需要大量的能量
Producing an egg takes a huge amount of energy,

64
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,180
企鹅妈妈们要消耗四分之一的体重
such that the females lose a quarter of their body weight.

65
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,880
它已经一个多月没有进食
She hasn't eaten for over a month

66
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,790
需要回到大海中去觅食
and needs to return to the ocean to feed.

67
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,710
它不能带着宝贝企鹅蛋一起去
She can't take her precious egg with her,

68
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,030
必须将它交给伴侣来照顾
so she must pass it to her partner to care for.

69
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,340
企鹅爸爸有一个贴近皮肤的特殊育儿袋
He has a special brood pouch to keep it warm,

70
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,250
来为企鹅蛋保暖
close to his skin.

71
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,670
如果它不能迅速让蛋离开冰面
If he doesn't get the egg off the ice quickly,

72
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,200
蛋就会冻住
it will freeze.

73
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,360
现在它可以离开了
Now, she is free to go.

74
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,270
但它看起来有些不舍
But she does seem rather reluctant to leave.

75
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,970
现在它将在漫长的严冬中
He will now have sole responsibility for their egg

76
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,860
独自照顾它们的蛋
all through the long, harsh winter.

77
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,420
在蛋孵化前
He won't see his partner again

78
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,360
它的伴侣不会回来
until the egg has hatched.

79
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,660
接下来几天  群落中所有的企鹅妈妈
Over the next few days, every female in the colony

80
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,790
都按原路疾行二十四千米
hurries away on the same 15-mile march

81
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,990
到达海边
to the sea.

82
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:25,040
寒风从大陆中心吹来
A freezing wind blowing in from the heart of the continent

83
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,130
气温急剧下降
drives the temperature down.

84
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,980
为了给自己和企鹅蛋保暖
To keep themselves and their eggs warm,

85
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,890
企鹅爸爸们展现出自然界中
the males now perform one of the most spectacular

86
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,510
最壮观的合作场面之一
demonstrations of cooperation in nature.

87
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,100
一只接一只
One by one,

88
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,100
它们紧紧地挤成一团
they lock themselves into a huddle...

89
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,060
四千多只企鹅爸爸
Creating a giant incubator

90
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,250
组成一个巨大的孵化器
made up of over 4,000 male penguins.

91
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:52,220
每一只都不断尝试挤进最佳位置
Each individual constantly tries to push into the best possible position

92
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,710
为自己和企鹅蛋保暖
to keep himself and his egg warm.

93
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,780
于是
As a result,

94
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,440
整群企鹅一直保持动态
the entire huddle is forever on the move.

95
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,380
风暴级强风
Storm force winds

96
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:46,000
使温度下降到零下六十摄氏度
now drive the temperature down to -60 Celsius.

97
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,880
对外层承受寒风的
For the emperors on the outside,

98
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,370
帝企鹅来说
facing the wind,

99
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,290
气候条件变得难以忍受
the conditions become unbearable.

100
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,130
它们别无选择  只能脱离群体
They have no choice but to break off

101
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,720
尝试绕到有掩蔽的一侧去
and try to get round to the sheltered side.

102
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,850
它必须站起来
He must get back on his feet,

103
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,930
但不能让企鹅蛋滑出来
but without letting go of his egg.

104
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,060
如果失败  蛋中的胚胎
If he fails, the embryo inside

105
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,590
会很快冻住  然后死去
will rapidly freeze and die.

106
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,120
绕到有掩蔽的一侧后
Once they arrive on the sheltered side of the huddle,

107
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,120
它们得以从寒风中稍作喘息
they get some relief from the wind.

108
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,600
这里的暴风雪
When a blizzard sets in here,

109
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,980
会连续肆虐数天
it rages for days on end.

110
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,310
现在  伤亡显露出来
Now, the casualties are revealed.

111
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,560
伤痕累累  饥寒交迫  精疲力竭
Battered, starving and exhausted,

112
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,950
这些生还者仍不能放松
there is still no relief for the survivors.

113
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,430
暴风雪使他们将近移动两千米
The storm has driven them nearly a mile

114
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,980
偏离了最安全的冰上通道
from the safest path of the ice.

115
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,940
返回原来的位置是一趟疲惫的旅程
It's a weary march back to where they started from.

116
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,890
现在  它们又重新挤成一团
Now, they re-form their huddle,

117
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,030
准备对抗下一场暴风雪
to be ready for the next storm...

118
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,170
暴风雪必然会再次来临
..Which will come, inevitably.

119
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:15,020
两个月的恶劣气候之后
Only after two months of brutal weather

120
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,840
极夜终于结束了
does the polar night finally come to an end.

121
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,260
随之而来的是一丝暖意
And with it comes a hint of warmth.

122
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,810
太阳的回归正与
The return of the sun coincides

123
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:55,630
群落中新成员的诞生同步
with the appearance of the newest members of the colony.

124
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,620
几天之内就将新增几千张
In a matter of days, there are thousands

125
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,150
饥饿的嘴  嗷嗷待哺
of hungry mouths, all demanding food.

126
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,100
它们的爸爸们已将近四个月没有进食
Their fathers haven't eaten anything for nearly four months.

127
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,660
不过它们保存了重要储备
Yet they have kept back a vital reserve,

128
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,330
一种浓浓的企鹅奶
a kind of thick penguin milk,

129
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,310
专为此刻准备
just for this moment.

130
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:20,650
但是这只能让企鹅宝宝存活几天
But it's only enough to keep the chick alive for a few days.

131
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,750
企鹅妈妈们必须尽快带着食物回来
The females must return soon with food.

132
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,760
对一些宝宝来说  已经来不及了
For some, it's already too late.

133
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,590
第一批企鹅妈妈们正在回来的路上
The first of the females are returning.

134
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,750
丰腴饱足  越来越多
Fat and well fed, more arrive,

135
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,930
都带着给企鹅宝宝的食物
all with food for the chicks.

136
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,660
企鹅爸爸们已迫不及待
And not a moment too soon for the waiting fathers.

137
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,070
企鹅妈妈第一次见到自己的宝宝
A mother's first sight of her young chick.

138
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,700
重新确认纽带后
With their bond reaffirmed,

139
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,910
企鹅一家开始庆祝
the whole family celebrates.

140
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,410
终于  企鹅爸爸可以
Now at last, he can hand over

141
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,210
将宝贝小企鹅交给妈妈了
his precious chick to its mother.

142
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,380
但是也有些企鹅妈妈遭受不幸
But there are less fortunate females here,

143
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,560
它们的宝宝死了
whose chicks have died.

144
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,660
可是它们的育儿本能仍然很强烈
Yet their parenting instinct is still strong.

145
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,750
移交企鹅宝宝的这一幕
The sight of a youngster being handed over

146
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,960
让它们难以抗拒
is irresistible.

147
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,480
更多失去宝宝的企鹅妈妈加入混战
More chickless females join in the melee.

148
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,240
企鹅宝宝看起来很安全
The chick appears to be safe...

149
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,980
但是它离开了亲生父母
But it is no longer with its true parents.

150
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,110
被绑架的小企鹅从来不会有好下场
The prospects for a kidnapped chick are never good.

151
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,800
尽管这对企鹅过去三个月付出了巨大努力
Despite their immense efforts over the last three months,

152
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:13,780
它们的努力没有施展的对象
this couple have nothing to show for it.

153
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,520
对那些成功的父母来说
For those couples that have been successful,

154
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,590
现在轮到企鹅爸爸回到海中去
it's the father's turn to head back to sea

155
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,950
它们迫切需要饱餐一顿
to get a much-needed meal for himself...

156
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,180
并承担为它们的宝宝觅食的责任
..And to take his turn collecting food for the chick.

157
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,940
企鹅妈妈现在可以和刚出世的宝宝
The mother is now able to bond

158
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,610
建立纽带
with her new baby...

159
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,760
更紧急的是  喂养宝宝
..And, urgently, to feed it.

160
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,840
这是它第一次尝到海产
Its first taste of sea food.

161
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:22,450
但苦难还未结束
But the times of hardship are not over.

162
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,780
又一场暴风雪
Another storm,

163
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,620
又一场雪茫
and another white-out.

164
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,760
对一些企鹅来说  这是一场灾难
For some, this is a catastrophe.

165
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,180
它们跌入了冰上的一处深沟
They have tumbled into a ravine in the ice...

166
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,750
四周都是陡峭光滑的冰墙
..With steep, slippery walls.

167
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:16,000
企鹅宝宝现在成了致命的累赘
Chicks are now a deadly burden.

168
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:21,290
带着宝宝的妈妈无法攀冰
Mothers carrying young cannot grip the ice.

169
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,390
如果妈妈出不去
If she doesn't get out,

170
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,450
它们都会死
they will both die.

171
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,790
这只企鹅妈妈不得不做出可怕的抉择
This mother has had to make a terrible choice.

172
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,780
为了自救
To save herself,

173
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,580
它抛弃了自己的宝宝
she has abandoned her chick.

174
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:26,280
至少  有一只企鹅妈妈不打算放弃它的宝宝
One mother, at least, is not prepared to give up on her chick.

175
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,210
妈妈和宝宝都安全了
Mother and chick are safe.

176
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,600
偶尔
There is, occasionally,

177
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,770
南极洲的无情也会暂息
a respite from the brutality of Antarctica.

178
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,230
天空晴朗  微风吹拂
Clear skies, gentle winds...

179
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:22,360
一场尤为壮观的南极光
..And a particularly spectacular display of the Southern Lights.

180
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,170
南极光
The Aurora Australis.

181
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:40,560
随着太阳越攀越高
As the sun climbs higher every day,

182
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,070
冰层转暖
it warms the ice.

183
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,600
很快  帝企鹅的冰封世界
Soon, the emperors' frozen world

184
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,000
将开始融化
will start to melt away.

185
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,130
在过去的几周里
For the last few weeks,

186
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,680
企鹅妈妈和爸爸
the mother and father have

187
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,250
轮流喂养它们的宝宝
taken it in turn to feed their offspring.

188
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:16,270
但很快  它日渐增长的胃口将迫使它的父母
But its growing appetite will soon force both parents to go away

189
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,720
同时出海捕鱼
fishing at the same time.

190
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,310
是时候鼓励满月的小企鹅
Now it's time to encourage the month-old chicks

191
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:40,640
用自己的双脚站立
to stand on their own two feet.

192
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,990
有时  父母需要适时把它们踢开
Sometimes, it takes a well-timed kick.

193
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,890
现在  父母都可以出海捕鱼了
Now, both parents can head off to sea to go fishing.

194
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,640
有生以来第一次
For the first time,

195
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,400
企鹅宝宝们要脱离父母的保护
the chicks will have to face the elements

196
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,530
独自面对自然了
without a parent to protect them.

197
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:53,150
其余成年企鹅并不会照料它们
Other adults certainly won't look after them.

198
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:03,200
于是孤单的企鹅宝宝聚在一起以求安慰
So, lone chicks gather together for comfort.

199
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,320
当温度降至零下二十五摄氏度时
As the temperature drops to -25,

200
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:36,070
企鹅宝宝们本能地挤作一团
the chicks instinctively create their own mini-huddle,

201
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,850
就像它们的爸爸一样
just as their fathers do.

202
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,820
此时此刻
This is no time

203
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,760
小企鹅万万不可脱离群体
for a youngster to be alone.

204
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,110
幸运的企鹅宝宝
If they're lucky,

205
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,790
此时或许仍有
some chicks may still have

206
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:18,800
捕鱼归来的父母保护
the protection of a parent taking a break from fishing.

207
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,030
但对于大多数幼崽来说
But for the majority,

208
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:32,200
紧抱成团给了它们仅有的庇护
the huddle is their only shelter.

209
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,440
即便天气恶劣  成年企鹅仍需
Even in this weather, adults must still

210
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,110
多次出海带回食物
head back and forth to the sea to bring back food.

211
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:18,340
幼崽跟随成年企鹅的本能依旧强烈
The instinct to follow adults is still strong.

212
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,610
但在暴风雪之中
But in a blizzard,

213
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,940
这种做法并不明智
that is a bad idea.

214
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,130
成年企鹅的离去
The adults' disappearance

215
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,580
让企鹅宝宝们困惑不已
leaves the chicks in confusion.

216
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,290
它迷茫而孤独  唯一的希望是
Lost and alone, his only hope

217
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:18,370
这只成年企鹅正在返回群落
is that this adult is heading back to the colony,

218
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:22,540
而非在冰冻废原上越走越远
and not away from it, across the frozen wastes.

219
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:08,410
最后一场风暴结束后
With the last of the big storms over,

220
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:11,220
夏天到来了
summer has arrived.

221
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:19,810
企鹅聚居的冰层开始消融
The ice that has been the penguins' home is melting.

222
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:32,400
企鹅宝宝们几乎发育完全
These chicks are almost fully grown,

223
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,780
即将独立
and approaching independence.

224
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,430
在它们下海之前  所有帝企鹅
Before they leave for the sea, all emperors -

225
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,880
不分长幼  都需要换毛
adults and their chicks, must moult.

226
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:21,170
对于小企鹅来说  这意味着它们步入了成年
For the youngsters, this marks the arrival of adulthood.

227
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,760
三分之二的幼崽历经磨难  得以生存
Against all the odds, two thirds have survived.

228
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:45,190
但逐年缩减的冰雪世界
But the annual disappearance of their ice world

229
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:49,670
正是企鹅命运未卜的警示
is a reminder that they face an uncertain future.

230
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:56,230
海洋温度年复一年地增加
Ocean temperatures are expected to rise year-on-year.

231
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:02,740
帝企鹅赖以生存的南极海冰
This Antarctic sea ice on which all emperor penguins rely

232
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,480
或许会过早融化
may not freeze for long enough each year

233
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,160
使它们来不及完成非凡的生命周期
for them to complete their extraordinary life cycle.

234
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:19,600
当整个群落准备离开阿特卡湾时
But, as the whole colony prepares to leave Atka Bay...

235
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,340
这些企鹅父母成功养育了
These parents have successfully raised

236
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:30,700
帝企鹅王朝的下一代
the next generation in this emperors' dynasty.
