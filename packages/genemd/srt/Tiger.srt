3
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,340
老虎是体型最大  最威武
Tigers are the largest, most powerful,

4
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,650
或许也是最受人喜爱的大型猫科动物
and perhaps the most loved of all the big cats.

5
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,100
然而在过去的一个世纪里
Yet, over the past century,

6
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,140
老虎的数量减少了百分之九十五
their numbers have declined by 95%.

7
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,140
20世纪初虎的数量约有10万只而现在世界自然基金会估计全球仅存3890只虎

8
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,530
我们的团队花费两年时间
Our team has spent two years

9
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,570
追踪一只母虎和它的幼崽
following one tigress with her cubs

10
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,850
记录它养育幼崽的过程
as she attempts to rear them.

11
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,910
它面临的挑战不仅源于自然
Her problems come not just from the natural world,

12
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,510
更源于生存在人类附近
but from having to do so at close quarters with us.

13
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,240
位于印度中心的班达迦老虎保护区
Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in the heart of India.

14
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,210
这里是一片富足的热带丛林
A rich, tropical jungle.

15
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,690
在这个悬崖脚下
At the base of this cliff,

16
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,990
有一个秘密洞穴
a secret cave

17
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,420
里面藏着
hiding within

18
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,540
一只名叫拉吉贝拉的母虎
is a tigress known as Raj Bera

19
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,280
两周前  它在这个洞穴
Two weeks ago, she chose this cave

20
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,290
产下新的家庭成员
in which to give birth to her new family.

21
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,340
这是它的女儿  比芭
This is her daughter, Biba.

22
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,860
这是它摇摇晃晃踏出的最初几步
And these are her first, rather unsteady steps.

23
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,560
比芭有三个兄弟
Biba has three brothers.

24
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,120
四只幼崽
The four of them together

25
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,270
是这个老虎王朝的下一代
are the next generation of this tiger dynasty.

26
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,490
拉吉贝拉是地球上最强大的捕食者之一
Raj Bera is one of the most formidable predators on earth.

27
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,140
但它的幼崽在接下来的两年时间里
But her cubs are vulnerable and will remain so

28
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,480
都十分脆弱
for the next two years.

29
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,260
作为母亲  它要尽其所能发挥本领
It will take all her strength and skill as a mother

30
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,170
保护并养育幼崽
to protect and provide for them,

31
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,330
才能将它们抚养到成年
if she is to raise them to adulthood.

32
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,760
虎

33
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,940
这片森林有老虎家庭生活所需的一切
This forest has everything a tiger family needs.

34
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,950
充足的淡水
Plenty of fresh water,

35
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,740
可供藏身的密集灌木
dense thickets for concealment,

36
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,120
还有遍布猎物的开阔草原
and open grasslands full of prey.

37
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,030
在巢穴中与幼崽挨过饥肠辘辘的两周之后
After two hungry weeks confined to the den with her cubs,

38
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,580
拉吉贝拉需要食物
Raj Bera needs food.

39
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,040
它是个经验丰富的猎手
She is an experienced hunter.

40
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,130
但它的猎物时刻保持高度警觉
But her prey are always on high alert.

41
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,420
幸好  它知道如何隐藏踪迹
Fortunately, she knows how to disappear.

42
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,310
尽管经验丰富
Even with her experience,

43
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,850
多数狩猎都会如此收场
most hunts end this way.

44
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,400
但现在它面临一个两难困境
But now she faces a dilemma.

45
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,790
夜幕开始降临
As evening draws in,

46
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,500
把幼崽独自留在巢穴
leaving the cubs unprotected in their den

47
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,250
可能招致危险
could put them in danger.

48
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,710
夜行捕食者已徘徊在外
The night shift are already on the prowl.

49
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,300
一头懒熊
A sloth bear.

50
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,660
如果发现幼崽  它会将其猎杀
It will kill cubs if it can ﬁnd them.

51
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,640
巢穴一旦被发现  就不再安全
Once a den has been discovered, it’s no longer safe.

52
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,570
它需要搬家
She needs to move her family.

53
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,890
迁至新巢后全家安全
The family are safe at a new den.

54
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,450
像拉吉贝拉这样经验丰富的母虎
An experienced tigress like Raj Bera

55
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,590
可能知道数个像这样的藏匿处
may know half a dozen hideaways like this.

56
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,850
尽管它捕猎失败
Even though she failed in her hunt,

57
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,160
幼崽依然渴望它的乳汁
the cubs are as hungry for milk as ever.

58
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,400
养育并保护多达四只幼崽
For a tigress to feed and protect,

59
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,640
对于母虎来说是严峻的挑战
as many as four young is a relentless challenge.

60
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,620
它不太可能将所有幼崽都养大
It's unlikely that she will be able to raise them all.

61
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,920
而如今在印度
And in India today,

62
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,080
新的压力使抚养幼崽至成年
there are new pressures, making it harder than ever

63
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,600
变得前所未有的艰难
to rear a family to adulthood.

64
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:38,400
拉吉贝拉的领地面积刚好够它养育幼崽
Raj Bera's territory is just big enough to support her cubs,

65
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,580
拉吉贝拉

66
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,130
但它被其它老虎的领地包围
but she's surrounded by territories held by other tigers.

67
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,020
而整个保护区被人类居住区环绕
And all are encircled by human settlement.

68
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,440
班达迦老虎保护区

69
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,480
班达迦共有约八十只老虎
There are about 80 tigers in Bandhavgarh.

70
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,180
密度高得非比寻常
This is an unusually high density.

71
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,940
对于生存空间的竞争十分激烈
Competition for space is intense.

72
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:39,380
脸上的伤疤是对手间争斗的证明
Scarred faces are evidence of battles between rivals.

73
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
为了保证领地安全
To keep her territory secure,

74
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,020
拉吉贝拉定期在长达十九千米的边界巡逻
Raj Bera regularly patrols its 12-mile-long boundary.

75
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,080
它每次喷尿  都是在标记
Each time she sprays, she's marking a line

76
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,360
其它老虎不得逾越的界线
that other tigers know they cross at their peril.

77
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,460
耐着正午的酷热标记领地十分辛苦
Territory marking in the midday heat is hard work.

78
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,800
它需要降温
She needs to cool off.

79
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,050
一只多情的雄孔雀
An amorous male peacock.

80
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,170
每一天
Every day,

81
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,190
它都在三项任务间取得近乎不可能的平衡
she has to strike an almost impossible balance,

82
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,970
分配时间进行捕猎
dividing her time between hunting,

83
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,520
对领地边界进行气味标记
scent marking her boundaries,

84
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,710
以及照料幼崽
and nursing her cubs.

85
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,500
目前  幼崽的需求必须优先满足
For now the demands of her young family must take precedence.

86
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,730
它的幼崽已成长到开始探索的阶段
Her cubs have reached the stage when they start exploring.

87
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,570
尽管它们仍未完全学会走路
Although even walking hasn't been completely mastered.

88
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,310
幼崽之间的差异逐渐显现
Differences between the cubs are beginning to appear.

89
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,240
三个兄弟忙着打闹
The three brothers are caught up in a rough and tumble.

90
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,310
但它们的姐妹比芭  踌躇退缩
But their sister, Biba, holds back.

91
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,690
它体型较小  也不如它的兄弟强壮
She is smaller and not as strong as her brothers.

92
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,620
这些差异只会随着它们的成长
And these differences will only become more apparent,

93
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,370
变得愈发明显
as they grow older.

94
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,280
两个月后
Two months later

95
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,380
老虎一家永远地离开了巢穴
and the family has left the den for good.

96
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,850
幼崽现已足够强壮  能跟上母亲
The cubs are now strong enough to follow their mother.

97
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,790
母虎必须开始教育幼崽了
She must now start on their education.

98
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,250
它带它们巡视领地
She shows them around her territory.

99
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,130
更重要的是  带它们品尝一种新食物
And most importantly, introduces them to a new diet.

100
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,020
肉
Meat.

101
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,040
幼崽的体型长大了一倍
The cubs have doubled in size,

102
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,710
所以它必须更频繁地狩猎
so that she has to hunt even more frequently

103
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,470
来满足它们日益增长的胃口
to provide for their growing appetites.

104
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,820
自从它的幼崽出生
Since the birth of her cubs,

105
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,240
拉吉贝拉便无法像过去那样
Raj Bera has not been able to patrol her territory

106
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,490
定期巡逻领地
as regularly as she did.

107
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,030
这使对手有机可乘
And that has given a rival an opportunity.

108
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,900
这是索萝
This is Solo,

109
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,750
拉吉贝拉的成年女儿
Raj Bera's adult daughter.

110
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,270
它擅自闯入了母亲的领土
And she is trespassing on her mother's lands,

111
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,830
整个班达迦最富饶的地方之一
some of the richest in the whole of Bandhavgarh.

112
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,440
它或许不知道拉吉贝拉在这里狩猎
She may be unaware that Raj Bera is hunting here.

113
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,920
通常成年老虎会相互避开
Normally adult tigers avoid each other.

114
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,400
因为即便是母女打斗也有可能致命
Because ﬁghts even between mother and daughter can be fatal.

115
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,990
不过目前  索萝似乎是在试探它的母亲
But now, Solo appears to be testing her mother.

116
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,540
面对拉吉贝拉稳操胜券的步伐
Faced with Raj Bera's confident advance,

117
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,610
索萝立刻表现出顺从
Solo immediately defers,

118
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,100
像幼崽一样露出腹部
rolling on her back like a cub.

119
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,690
它还不够成熟  不够强壮
She's not old enough or strong enough

120
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,920
难以争夺领土
to challenge for the territory...

121
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,210
暂时不能
Yet.

122
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,410
拉吉贝拉仍然是这里的统治者
Raj Bera is still the ruler here.

123
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,720
但是索萝发出了警告
But Solo has issued a warning.

124
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,060
领土重归安全
With their territory secure,

125
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,830
全家得以一起放松
the family can relax together.

126
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,810
幼崽现在把越来越多的时间
The cubs are now spending more and more time

127
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,210
用在锻炼协调性和灵活性上
developing their coordination and agility.

128
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,070
它们从游戏中学习
And they do that through play.

129
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,970
一头野猪
A wild boar.

130
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,330
它可能是成年老虎菜单上的美味
It could be on the menu of an adult tiger.

131
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,510
但其中一只幼年公虎有点急功近利
But one of the male cubs is being a little ambitious.

132
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,600
还是等等吧
Perhaps not yet.

133
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,120
班达迦的冬季降临
Winter arrives in Bandhavgarh.

134
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,490
幼崽九个月大了
The cubs are nine months old.

135
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,350
步入了青春期
In their adolescence.

136
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,620
邻居开始对它们更加提防
And the neighbours are beginning to take them more seriously.

137
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,840
目前拉吉贝拉顺利让它的幼崽都活了下来
Raj Bera has done well to keep all her cubs alive so far.

138
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,810
一般只有百分之五十的幼崽
Typically only 50% of tiger cubs

139
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,820
能幸存到成年
survive to adulthood.

140
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,550
不过现在  家庭关系开始改变
But now, the family relationships are changing.

141
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:23,040
它不再让幼崽先吃
She no longer lets the cubs eat first.

142
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,360
它必须让它们明白总有一天
She has to teach them that one day

143
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,980
它们需要自力更生
they will have to provide for themselves.

144
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,640
等它饱食餍足
Once she has had her fill,

145
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,540
它的儿子占据尸体
her sons dominate the carcass.

146
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,040
只有等它们吃完
It's only when they have finished

147
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,930
体型较小的女儿  比芭
that their smaller sister, Biba,

148
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,310
才能不受打扰地进食
gets her chance to feed undisturbed.

149
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,380
警报提示有入侵者
Alarm calls warn of an intruder.

150
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,000
这次是一只成年公虎
This time it's an adult male tiger.

151
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,790
它的体型比拉吉贝拉大三分之一  更加强壮
He‘s a third bigger than Raj Bera and much more powerful.

152
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:56,120
这是幼崽最喜欢的水洼
This is the cubs' favourite water hole.

153
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,660
母亲和儿子
Mother and sons

154
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,640
饭后小憩
sleep off their meal.

155
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,970
但比芭独自离开
But Biba heads off alone.

156
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,740
成年公虎有时会杀死幼崽
Adult male tigers sometimes kill cubs,

157
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,930
所以接近一只公虎风险极高
so, to approach one is a huge risk.

158
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,930
当然  除非它是你的父亲
Unless of course he's your father,

159
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,380
森林里唯一不会伤害它的公虎
the only male in the forest who would never harm her.

160
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,360
公虎很少见到自己的后代
Tiger fathers rarely meet their offspring.

161
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:52,250
它似乎也不想跟女儿熟络
And he doesn't seem keen to get acquainted.

162
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,660
但是只要它在森林里巡逻
But while he is patrolling the forest,

163
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,700
其它公虎就会绕道而行
other males will keep away.

164
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,020
幼崽就是安全的
And the cubs will be safe.

165
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:25,670
至于其它的一切  幼崽依赖拉吉贝拉照料
For everything else, the cubs depend on Raj Bera.

166
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,370
它仍然需要供养整个家庭
She still has to provide for the whole family.

167
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,340
夏季到来
It's summer.

168
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,830
接下来的几周  灼热的高温
Over the next few weeks the searing heat

169
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,430
将会吸干这片土地上的水分
will suck the moisture from the land.

170
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:36,090
气温骤升  超过四十五摄氏度
Temperatures soar to over 45 degrees.

171
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:47,150
班达迦必须承受十年来最严重的干旱
And Bandhavgarh has to endure the worst drought in a decade.

172
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,670
这是秃鹫的好时机
It's a good time to be a vulture.

173
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,480
拉吉贝拉领地里的水洼
The water holes in Raj Bera's territory

174
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,100
吸引着保护区干渴难耐的居民
become magnets for the park's thirsty inhabitants.

175
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:25,200
通常  叶猴大部分时间
Normally, langurs spend most of their time

176
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,230
都在遥不可及的树上
out of reach in the trees.

177
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,260
但干旱期间
But during the drought,

178
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,880
它们必须冒险穿过开阔地带去喝水
they must risk crossing open ground to get water.

179
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,510
一旦勇敢的成年叶猴开始行动
Once the braver adults make their move,

180
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,620
剩下的成员便紧随其后
the rest of the troop follow.

181
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,730
离开安乐窝  它们紧张不安
Out of their comfort zone, they're nervous.

182
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,300
这里没有危险
No danger here,

183
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,900
至少在它看来
as far as she can see.

184
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:04,000
但是你不可能在喝水的同时观望四周
But you can't drink and watch all at the same time.

185
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,940
在拉吉贝拉的领土中心
Here in the heart of Raj Bera’s territory,

186
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,080
这些水洼成了旱季期间
these water holes become the focus of the family's life

187
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,950
家庭生活的焦点
throughout these driest months.

188
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,650
被吸引至水洼的不只有猎物
It's not just prey that are drawn here to the water holes.

189
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,060
新的入侵者
A new trespasser.

190
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:11,900
看来这只母虎今天不打算宣告主权
It seems this tigress is weary of pressing her claim today.

191
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,330
但是很显然现在有
But it's clear there are now

192
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,760
更多的对手觊觎拉吉贝拉的狩猎领地
more rivals for Raj Bera's hunting territory.

193
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,160
现在遥远的嚎叫预示着以后的麻烦
And now distant roars signal further trouble.

194
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,600
索萝  拉吉贝拉的成年女儿
Solo, Raj Bera's adult daughter,

195
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,140
正在进行第一次交配
is mating for the first time.

196
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,650
很快它会产下需要喂养的幼崽
She will soon have her own family with new mouths to feed.

197
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,840
那时离它回来就不远了
And it‘s not long before she's back,

198
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,650
在它母亲的领地深处狩猎
hunting deep in her mother's territory.

199
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,910
它在偷猎
She is poaching.

200
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:21,240
一岁大的幼崽需要互相
The year-old cubs are practising their hunting skills

201
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,270
磨练捕猎技术
on each other.

202
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:30,740
捕捉猎物需要力量和敏捷
Capturing prey requires power and agility.

203
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,220
同时还需伏击和攻击的能力
As well as the skills of ambush and attack.

204
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:53,540
为了生存它们需要掌握猎杀技巧
Their survival will depend on mastering the ability to kill.

205
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,630
但在未来的八个月里
But for another eight months,

206
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,450
母亲依然要继续喂养它们
their mother must continue to provide.

207
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,810
她捕猎的工作量也大大增加
And she's having to work much harder now.

208
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,070
即使是这般大小的猎物
Even a kill as big as this

209
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,320
也只够全家吃几天
won't last the family more than a couple of days.

210
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,560
它的儿子们先进食
Her sons are the first to every meal

211
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,590
并小心翼翼守护着自己那份食物
and jealously guard their share.

212
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,800
比芭只能等待
Biba is forced to wait.

213
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:57,620
倘若还剩零星碎肉就已经很幸运了
She will be lucky if she gets anything more than scraps.

214
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,100
离开它吃饱了的兄弟们
Leaving her well-fed brothers behind,

215
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,520
比芭试图自己捕猎
Biba tries to hunt for herself.

216
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,440
它已看过母亲多次示范
She's watched her mother do this many times.

217
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,280
跟踪猎物
Stalk,

218
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,120
并俯身
and drop.

219
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:13,320
它已经掌握了隐身技术
She has mastered the technique of becoming invisible.

220
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:22,060
但它的体型和力量都还不足以发起突袭
But she doesn't yet have the size or strength to strike.

221
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:40,640
强风预示着雨季的来临
Strong winds signal the arrival of the monsoon.

222
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,680
对多数居住在森林里的动物来说
The abundance of water means that,

223
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,030
充沛的水源意味着
for most of the forest's inhabitants,

224
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,230
好时节又回来了
the good times have returned.

225
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:43,280
但雨季对拉吉贝拉一家来说是最坏的季节
But the monsoon is the worst time for Raj Bera and her family.

226
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,930
它的猎物不再依赖于水洼
Her prey are no longer dependent on the water holes.

227
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,090
而是可以在它的领地里四散生活
They are now free to disperse throughout her territory.

228
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:06,190
这使伏击变得难上加难
They will be much harder for her to ambush.

229
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,190
几周后  在它领地的西界附近
A few weeks later near the western boundary of her lands,

230
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,590
发生了一场打斗
there has been a fight.

231
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,720
拉吉贝拉不幸负伤
And Raj Bera is injured.

232
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,760
母虎严重负伤
A serious injury to a mother tiger

233
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,670
意味着它的幼崽会挨饿
can mean starvation for her cubs.

234
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,730
比芭总是最后一个
Biba is invariably the last

235
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,790
享用母亲狩猎成果的孩子
to benefit from her mother's hunting.

236
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,440
它急需自力更生
She needs to fend for herself.

237
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:34,620
为此它必须找到属于自己的领地
And to do that, she must find her own territory,

238
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,430
远离它的兄弟
away from her brothers.

239
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,450
但它能去哪呢
But where can she go?

240
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:12,810
其他的领地早已被占领
Every other territory is already occupied.

241
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,710
它只能被迫离开班达迦向外搜寻
She's forced to search outside Bandhavgarh altogether.

242
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,250
它母亲也会与它永别
Her mother will never see her again.

243
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:54,070
雄性幼崽也饥肠辘辘
The male cubs are also going hungry.

244
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:19,370
它们也在试着自力更生
They, too, are trying to fend for themselves.

245
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:35,810
对于新手来说  鹿太过警觉
The deer are too alert for novices.

246
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,770
有三只嗷嗷待哺的青年雄性幼崽
With the demands of three adolescent male cubs

247
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:56,690
再加上它对手日渐增长的敌意
and increasing hostility from her rivals,

248
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,340
拉吉贝拉面临自己的王朝有史以来最大的威胁
Raj Bera is facing the greatest ever threat to her dynasty.

249
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,210
它迈了一大步
She takes a drastic step

250
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,700
离开安全的公园  希望找到更易捕猎之物
and leaves the safety of the park in the hope of easier prey.

251
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:19,070
邻近村庄的牛
Cattle in the neighbouring villages.

252
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:34,160
雌虎与人类之间一直存在冲突
For tigress and people, there is real danger here.

253
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:38,130
而且拉吉贝拉无法战胜对方
It's a conflict that Raj Bera cannot win.

254
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,480
次日黎明时分
Dawn, the next day.

255
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:16,250
拉吉贝拉
Raj Bera.

256
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,940
被公园工作人员解救
She was rescued by the park authorities

257
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,580
并重新回到自己的领地
and released back into her territory,

258
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,620
一家团聚
to rejoin her family.

259
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:05,920
过去两年里
Over the last two years,

260
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,490
它含辛茹苦养育自己的幼崽长大
she's struggled to raise her cubs safely to this point.

261
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:11,840
尽管失去了女儿
And although she's lost her daughter,

262
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:15,030
但它的儿子即将成年
her sons are on the brink of adulthood.

263
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:19,560
排除万难
Against the odds,

264
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,860
它仍有机会为自己的老虎王朝
she still has the chance to secure the future

265
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:24,750
提供一个美好的未来
of her tiger dynasty.
