4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,350
在非洲的中心
Here, in the heart of Africa,

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,600
这片辽阔的大陆上
lives one of this great continent's

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,980
生活着最特别却被误解的动物
most extraordinary yet misunderstood animals.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,400
这种动物依赖卓越的团队合作
Animals that only thrive through remarkable team work,

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,390
以及领袖的力量与本领繁衍生息
and through the strength and skill of their leaders.

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,320
杂色狼  曾被称为非洲野犬
Painted wolves, once known as Cape Hunting Dogs,

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,450
是非洲最濒危的捕食者之一
are one of Africa's most threatened predators.

11
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,690
狼群需要大面积的狩猎领地
Their packs require huge areas of territory in which to hunt.

12
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,040
但如今  来自于人类的压力
But today, because of human pressure,

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,590
使得它们的世界迅速缩小
their world is shrinking fast.

14
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,090
领地相邻的邻居
And whereas once neighbours

15
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,780
曾经可以相对和平地共处
could live together in relative peace,

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,140
如今  它们之间的竞争十分激烈
today there is intense rivalry between them.

17
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,640
在两年多的时间里
For more than two years,

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,990
我们在津巴布韦马纳波尔斯的团队
our team here in Mana Pools in Zimbabwe,

19
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,160
一直在追踪
have been following the fortunes

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,010
仅剩的几大家族之一的命运
of one of the last great families.

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,850
开始拍摄时
We join them at a moment

22
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,220
一位母亲与它其中一个女儿的竞争
when competition between mother and one of her daughters

23
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,660
正愈演愈烈
is boiling up,

24
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,700
不仅威胁到长久以来的和平
threatening to not only shatter a long-established peace,

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,510
更有可能分裂整个家族
but to tear apart the whole family.

26
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,300
杂色狼

27
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,880
这是泰特  统治这个家族的女王
This is Tait, the family's ruling queen.

28
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,910
它即是母亲  也是祖母
She's a mother and a grandmother.

29
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,210
多年以来  家族不断扩大
For years, she has used her position

30
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,830
它用自己的地位维持家族内部的和平
to keep the peace within her sprawling family.

31
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,210
但泰特现已衰老
But Tait is now old.

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
它的势力逐渐衰减
Her powers are waning.

33
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,690
泰特仍掌控着最佳的狩猎领地
Tait still controls the very best hunting territory,

35
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,400
赞比西河两岸富足的土地
the rich lands on the banks of the Zambezi.

36
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,950
但它被包围了
But she's surrounded.

37
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,500
东方是危险的狮群领地
To the east lie the dangerous lion pridelands.

39
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,790
南方是鬣狗聚居的森林
To the south, forests full of hyena.

41
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,030
而西方
And to the west,

42
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,270
是泰特的一个女儿黑蒂领导的狼群
a pack led by one of Tait's daughters, Blacktip.

44
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,880
多年以来  黑蒂与它的母亲
For many years, Blacktip has lived in peaceful coexistence

45
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,070
和平共处
with her mother,

46
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,340
双方都有足够的领地赖以生存
each with enough territory to survive.

47
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,410
但黑蒂的狼群愈发壮大
But Blacktip's pack has grown huge.

48
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,670
目前成员已达三十条
It's now 30 strong.

49
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,980
有生以来第一次  它需要更大的领地
For the first time, she needs more territory

50
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,510
来养活壮大的家族
if she's to feed her growing family.

51
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,080
通常  女儿不会侵略母亲的领地
Normally, a daughter would not invade her mother's territory.

52
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,010
然而  鬣狗统治南方
However, with hyenas ruling to the south,

53
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,930
人类占据西方的狩猎区域
and humans having taken the hunting lands to the west,

54
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,160
黑蒂别无选择
Blacktip has no choice

55
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,980
只能着眼东方
but to turn her sights east,

56
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,120
向它母亲的领地扩张
towards her mother's lands.

57
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,600
一场晨猎之后
Where, after a morning's hunt,

58
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,570
泰特和它的狼群正在休息
Tait and her pack are resting.

59
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,050
黑蒂的狼群比它母亲的
Blacktip's pack outnumbers her mother's

60
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,450
规模大一倍多
by more than two to one.

61
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,210
一场伏击
An ambush!

62
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,870
逆境重重
Against these odds,

63
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,180
泰特无能为力
Tait is powerless.

64
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,630
撤退是唯一的选择
Retreat is the only option.

65
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,140
从此这里成了黑蒂的领地
This has now become Blacktip's territory.

66
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,170
这场战斗短暂却血腥
A brief but bloody battle.

67
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,120
泰特和它的狼群如今无家可归
Tait and her pack are now homeless.

68
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,790
它向东撤退
She retreats eastwards.

69
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,480
但那里是危险区域
But this is dangerous country.

70
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,740
这条河是它原本的领地
This river marks the boundary between her old territory

71
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,530
与狮群领地的分界
and the lion pridelands.

72
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,280
在它漫长的一生中
In her long life,

73
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,520
泰特探索过马纳的每个角落
Tait has explored every part of Mana.

74
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,410
它知道在这里安家太过危险
She knows that this is too perilous a place to make a home.

75
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,780
狮子会搜捕猎杀杂色狼幼崽
Lions will search out and kill puppies,

76
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,590
若有机会  甚至会猎杀成年杂色狼
and even adults, if they get the chance.

77
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,930
目前这是唯一可以藏身的地方
For now, it's the only place to hide.

78
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,210
但泰特必须保护家族的安全
But Tait must keep her family safe,

79
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,380
避开那二十六头统治此地的狮子
well away from the 26 lions that rule here.

80
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:49,000
黑蒂抢夺领地已过去三个月
Three months have passed since Blacktip's takeover.

81
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,920
这片领地如今被它牢牢掌控
And all these lands are now firmly under her control.

82
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,900
黑蒂的狼群花费大量时间进行气味标记
Blacktip's pack have spent a great deal of time scent marking,

83
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,570
为它们的新领地确立边界
establishing their new territorial boundaries.

84
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,240
黑蒂和它的家族
And Blacktip and her family

85
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,330
从曾是它母亲的领地获取了丰富的食物
have fed well on what was her mother's lands.

86
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,560
但现在旱季来临  地形发生变化
But now, it's the dry season, and the landscape is changing.

87
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,040
对于靠速度取胜的猎手来说  地面布满危险
The ground is dangerous for hunters who rely on speed.

88
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,260
大象在淤泥中留下的深陷足印
Deep footprints left by elephants in soft mud

89
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,970
被烤得如石头一般坚硬
have baked as hard as rock.

90
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,110
杂色狼只要踏错一步
And a painted wolf putting a foot wrong

91
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,740
就可能身受重伤
could seriously damage itself.

92
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,290
黑斑羚能跃过地面深陷的坑
The impalas' ability to leap over the worst of the pot holes

93
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,560
这如今成为优势
now gives them an edge.

94
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,980
在这种情况下
In these conditions,

95
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,900
黑蒂的狼群将很难捕到食物
Blacktip's pack will find it hard to feed themselves.

96
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,960
但狼群的规模和力量
But the size and strength of the pack

97
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,300
或许能让它捕猎一种全新的猎物
might enable her to catch a totally new kind of prey.

98
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,830
大个的公狒狒十分强壮
A large male baboon is strong,

99
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,980
体重接近杂色狼的两倍
almost twice the weight of a painted wolf.

100
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,560
它们还有巨大的犬齿
And armed with huge canine teeth.

101
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,360
黑蒂狼群庞大的规模
The great size of Blacktip's pack

102
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,800
让公狒狒无力保护全员
means the large males can't defend their troupe

103
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,400
顾此失彼
against them all.

104
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,310
食物来之不易
The meal has been hard-won.

105
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,300
不过发现这个新机会的
But discovering this new possibility

106
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,900
时机恰到好处
has come at just the right time.

107
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,590
黑蒂在与泰特的领地争夺中
Blacktip won more than just hunting lands

108
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,500
不仅赢得更大的狩猎区域
in her battle to claim Tait's territory.

109
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,550
还占据了马纳波尔斯养育幼崽
She secured the safest place to raise puppies

110
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,980
最安全的地方
in all of Mana Pools.

111
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:40,060
果然  黑蒂产下五只嗷嗷待哺的幼崽
And sure enough, blacktip has a new litter of five hungry pups.

112
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,090
今天它们的父亲负责照料它们
Their father is babysitting them today.

113
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,260
它们都急切盼望狩猎队归来
Everyone is impatient for the return of the hunting party.

114
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,820
等待期间  幼崽发现
While they wait, the pups discover

115
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,470
世界远比它们的狼群更为广大
that there's more to the world than just their pack.

116
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,490
奇怪的巨兽
Strange giants.

117
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,830
黑蒂没空喘息
There's no rest for Blacktip.

118
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,040
它不仅要带领狩猎征程
She not only leads the hunting trips,

119
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,890
作为雌性首领  它还是唯一生育
but, as the alpha female, she's the only who breeds

120
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,510
并分泌乳汁的母狼
and provides milk for the pups.

121
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,380
现在除了乳汁
It's not just milk.

122
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,790
幼崽已经急不可待地开始吃肉
They're already eagerly eating meat.

123
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,750
黑蒂掌控泰特的领地是值得的
Blacktip's hold on Tait's territory appears to be paying off.

124
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,110
泰特和它的狼群被流放
It has been four months

125
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,690
进入狮群领地
since Tait and her pack were forced into exile

126
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,580
已有四个月
here in the lion pridelands.

127
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,490
与它原本的领地相比  这里不仅更危险
Compared to her home territory, there is not only more danger,

128
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,970
而且猎物更稀少
but there's much less prey.

129
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,440
令人惊叹的是  即便如此
Yet, remarkably, even here,

130
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,540
泰特还是保住了狼群全员的性命
Tait has managed to keep every member of her pack alive.

131
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,470
不过现在它却不见踪影
But she is nowhere to be seen.

132
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,770
家族里的其它成员
The rest of her family

133
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:30,670
都守在一个废弃的食蚁兽洞穴附近
are waiting close to an abandoned aardvark burrow.

134
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,240
原来如此
And this is why.

135
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,720
过去三周  泰特都藏在地下洞穴里
Tait has spent the last three weeks hidden underground.

136
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,330
尽管困难重重  它还是产下了
She has managed, against the odds,

137
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,080
它的第八窝幼崽
to produce her eighth litter.

138
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,660
两只幼崽第一次出现
Two tiny puppies emerge for the very first time.

139
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,750
蜜獾
Honey badgers.

140
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,540
它们恶名昭彰地好斗
They are notoriously aggressive,

141
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,820
对幼崽来说是威胁
and a danger to the pups.

142
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:15,310
泰特最小的女儿  塔米  从未见过蜜獾
Tait's youngest daughter, Tammy, has never seen one before.

143
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,410
但是本能告诉它要赶走它们
But her instinct tells her to drive them away.

144
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,670
泰特借此机会
And this gives Tait the chance

145
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,250
把幼崽安全地带回洞穴里
to get her pups to safety underground.

146
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,620
今年  泰特和黑蒂
This year, both Tait and Blacktip

147
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,530
产下的幼崽都比往年少很多
have produced far fewer puppies than ever before.

148
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,680
也许这标志着
Perhaps this is the first sign

149
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,400
两个狼群之间的冲突
that the conflict between the two packs

150
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,590
开始威胁到整个家族的未来
is threatening the future of the entire family.

151
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,750
每天两次
Twice a day,

152
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,460
泰特要带领它的狩猎队踏上危险的征途
Tait has to lead her hunting party on a risky journey

153
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:26,390
前往赞比西河河岸  猎物在那里聚集
to the banks of the Zambezi river, where the prey gather.

154
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,710
但那里也正是
But it is also the very heart

155
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,110
狮子领地的中心
of lion territory.

156
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,560
它必须不被察觉地带它们潜入
She must sneak them into position undetected.

157
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,230
然后最好速战速决
Then, it's in and out as fast as possible.

158
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,890
狼群需要快速行动
The pack need to work fast.

159
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,650
所有辛劳只换来几口果腹之食
All that effort for a few mouthfuls of food.

160
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,380
今天幼崽要挨饿了
The puppies will go hungry today.

161
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,120
雪上加霜
And the pack has been dealt another blow.

162
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,850
又是塔米  泰特最小的女儿
Again it's Tammy, Tait's youngest daughter,

163
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,620
发现了问题
who spots the problem.

164
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,270
塔米的姐姐倒下了
Tammy's sister has fallen.

165
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,000
它绊倒在大象的足印坑里  摔断了一条腿
She has broken a leg stumbling into an elephant's footprint.

166
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,050
对大多数动物来说  这意味着死亡
For most animals, this would be the end.

167
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:12,820
但这个家族不会抛下它自生自灭
But the family won't just leave her to fend for herself.

168
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,570
杂色狼也许比任何其它动物
Painted wolves, perhaps more than any other animal,

169
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,640
都更照顾老弱病残的成员
care for pack members who are old or injured.

170
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,740
在它不能参与狩猎期间
Tait's family will protect and feed her

171
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,470
泰特的家族会保护并养活它
while she herself cannot join in the hunt.

172
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,760
旱季变成干旱
The dry season turns to drought.

173
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,420
水牛群在迁徙
The great buffalo herds are on the move.

174
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:25,000
食物和水变得越来越匮乏
Food and water are becoming increasingly scarce.

175
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:33,740
如今马纳的所有居民汇集至赞比西河
AlI of Mana's inhabitants are now drawn towards the Zambezi

176
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,210
及其沿岸仅剩的几个水塘
and the few pools that remain along its banks.

177
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,790
干旱也意味着黑蒂和它的幼崽
The drought also means that it's time for Blacktip and her pups

178
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,270
该离开它们的巢穴了
to leave their den behind.

179
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,430
对幼崽来说  这是第一次冒险
For the pups, this is their first adventure.

180
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,820
现在幼崽已经可以跟上成年狼群
Now the pups are old enough to follow the adults,

181
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:00,200
黑蒂可以继续标记领地的新边界
Blacktip can resume marking the new boundaries of her territory

182
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,670
以巩固它的占领
to consolidate her takeover.

183
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,490
在最远的东部边界
On the far eastern borders,

184
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,730
黑蒂闻到一个熟悉的气味
Blacktip picks up a familiar scent.

185
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,110
气味陈旧  但是毋庸置疑
It's old, but unmistakable.

186
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,900
是它的母亲
Her mother.

187
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:57,380
这一发现对黑蒂影响巨大
This discovery has an extraordinary effect on Blacktip.

188
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:03,260
它能从中判断泰特行进的方向
She can tell from this smell which direction Tait took.

189
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,520
黑蒂不再标记领地
Blacktip stops territorial marking

190
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,220
而是开始追踪它的母亲
and instead sets off in pursuit of her mother.

191
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:23,480
看来黑蒂要尽力把泰特永远地
It seems that Blacktip is going to try and drive Tait out of Mana

192
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,380
逐出马纳
once and for all.

193
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,220
但是踏入未知地域
But she's taking a huge risk

194
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,050
它冒了巨大的风险
by going into territory she doesn't know.

195
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,340
鬣狗
Hyenas.

196
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,400
月黑风高夜  狼群通常会找安全地点
On moonless nights, the pack would normally rest up

197
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,160
休息到天亮
somewhere safe until dawn.

198
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,940
但这一次  黑蒂带领它们
But instead, Blacktip leads them,

199
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,780
步入黑暗
marching on into the gloom.

200
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,500
谁也不想在黑暗中掉队
No one wants to be the straggler in the dark.

201
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:42,710
夜间这个家族聚得更紧
The family bunch together much more closely at night.

202
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,000
现在  十五条鬣狗在跟踪它们
And now, 15 hyenas are tracking them.

203
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,450
进攻也许是最好的防御手段
Attack may be the best form of defense.

204
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,310
黑蒂以为它占据上风
Blacktip thinks she's got the upper hand,

205
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,530
可是它让幼崽落单了
but she's let her pups get separated.

206
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:06,000
幼崽没了
The puppy is lost.

207
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:33,400
低头垂尾  它们似乎在哀悼
Heads down, tails down, they seem to mourn.

208
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,070
它们沉默地行进数小时
For hours, they march in silence.

209
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,540
气氛庄严
A solemn procession.

210
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,240
尽管痛失幼崽  黑蒂依然带领狼群前进
Despite her loss, Blacktip drives her pack on,

211
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,550
远远越过泰特原本的领地边界
far beyond the boundary of Tait's old territory.

212
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:07,730
追踪母亲  它来到从未踏足过的地方
Tracking her mother into a place she's never been before,

213
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,860
深入狮群领地的中心
deep into the heart of the lion pridelands.

214
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,030
令人惊叹的是
Tait, remarkably,

215
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,560
泰特已在狮口下保护它的狼群
has now managed to keep her pack safe from the lions

216
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,960
长达八个月
for eight months.

217
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,570
它受伤的女儿在康复中
Her injured daughter is on the mend.

218
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,050
在它恢复期间  这个家族一直在保护它
The family have been protecting her while she recovers.

219
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,890
它们能活下来
They only survive here

220
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,620
靠得是一刻也不松懈的警惕
by being on constant alert for signs of danger.

221
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,430
今天风中散发着危险的气味
And today it is the wind that carries a warning.

222
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,540
黑蒂要来了
Blacktip is coming.

223
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:40,060
得到预警  泰特不打算冒险迎战
Forewarned, Tait isn't going to risk an attack.

224
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,270
狼群掉头逃跑
The pack turns tail and runs.

225
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,020
气温达到五十摄氏度
The temperature has reached 50 degrees.

226
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,330
可黑蒂还是带领狼群穷追不舍
Still, Blacktip pushes her pack on in pursuit.

227
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:27,850
它们逼近泰特  距离不到两千米
They're closing in, less than a mile behind Tait.

228
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,650
但最终  高温难以招架
But, finally, the heat is just too much.

229
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,980
黑蒂被迫停止追赶
Blacktip is forced to call a halt.

230
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,840
但是危险正在迫近
But danger is approaching.

231
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,570
狼群被打散
The pack has scattered!

232
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,460
狮子们因而可以专挑幼狼来攻击
And now the lions will try to pick off the puppies.

233
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:14,280
只有一条成年杂色狼与幼狼们在一起
There's only one adult with the pups.

234
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,520
那不足以保护它们
That won't be enough to save them.

235
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,480
但这个也许能
But this might.

236
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:00,190
水牛和狮子的冲突时刻不断
Buffaloes and ions are always in conflict.

237
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:09,880
只身冲入狮群是非常少见的
To charge in alone is very unusual.

238
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,550
但是它的确是救了幼狼们
But it's certainly saved the pups.

239
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:47,060
黑蒂和狼群的追踪被迫终止
Blacktip and her pack have been halted in their tracks.

240
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,010
黑蒂对泰特的追击
Blacktip's pursuit of Tait

241
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:10,280
把它的族群暴露于太多的危险之中
has exposed her family to too many dangers,

242
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,250
风险太大了
too many risks.

243
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,540
族群虽想竭力施以援手
The pack are desperate to help,

244
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,360
但是它们实在无能为力
but there is nothing they can do.

245
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,920
对泰特的追击彻底终结
The pursuit of Tait is over.

246
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,600
黑蒂的族群逃了
Blacktip's pack run.

247
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,830
它们逃啊逃啊
They run, and run.

248
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,540
逃过一沟又一壑
Mile after mile.

249
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,400
幼狼们紧跟着
Puppies in tow.

250
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:37,560
日夜兼程
All through the day, all through the night.

251
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,110
一直回到了家园
All the way home.

252
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,930
它们放弃了夺取的领地
The territory they stole, abandoned.

253
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,390
冲突结束了
The conflict is over.

254
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,730
代价太惨重了
It cost too much.

255
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:29,230
泰特和它的族群能感觉出黑蒂的撤退
Tait and her pack can already sense Blacktip's retreat.

256
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,900
从冲突爆发以来
For the first time since the beginning of the conflict,

257
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,900
它们第一次放松了下来
they appear relaxed.

258
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:43,060
很快它们敏锐的嗅觉
Soon, their keen sense of smell

259
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,040
就会告诉它们  被夺去的领地已经被放弃了
will tell them their stolen territory is no longer occupied.

260
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:57,560
用不了多久
It won't be long until it's time

261
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,530
泰特的族群也要回家了
for Tait's pack to also go home.

262
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,720
但是泰特不会跟它们一起回去了
But Tait will not be joining them.

263
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,050
在长达七年半的时间里
For seven-and-a-half years,

264
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:14,250
它一直是它们的领袖  它们的女王
she's been their leader, their matriarch.

265
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:23,490
如今它们的流亡行将结束
And now, as their exile finally draws to a close,

266
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,170
它确保了它的族群还能继续生存
she has ensured her pack still have a future,

267
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,120
真正有机会重拾故土
a real chance to reclaim their old territory.

268
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:49,370
就在它的族群终于可以回家的时候
Before her pack could, at last, head home,

269
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,830
无情的岁月终于找上了泰特
age finally caught up with Tait.

270
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,090
年纪太过老迈  动作过于迟缓
Too old, too slow,

271
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:01,320
它已经无法躲避狮子
she was no longer able to evade the lions.

272
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:08,500
它的雄性伴侣拒绝放弃它
Her alpha male refused to abandon her.

273
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,310
它们一起死在了狮群领地里
Together, they died in the pridelands.

274
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:25,640
泰特的族群群龙无首
Tait's pack are left leaderless.

275
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,040
但是故事并没有随着泰特的去世而结束
But the story doesn't end with Tait's passing.

276
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,290
滋养万物的雨水在干旱之后来了
Life-giving rains follow the drought.

277
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,310
曾经的艰难时刻很快因富庶充盈被淡忘
Hard times are quickly forgotten in times of plenty.

278
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,960
而故事再次出现转折
And the story takes another twist.

279
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,690
在回家的路上
On their way home,

280
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:48,120
泰特的族群吸引到了一队游荡的雄性杂色狼
Tait's pack attract a band of roving males.

281
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:52,260
随着生力军的增援
And with these reinforcements,

282
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,720
它们不但收复了一部分泰特从前的领地
they not only reclaim some of Tait's old territory,

283
00:45:55,830 --> 00:46:00,150
而且还上演了一场以前从未被看到的仪式
but also perform a ritual never witnessed before.

284
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:07,170
它们以这种令人难以忘记的叫声
With these haunting calls,

285
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,070
来选择新的领袖
they are choosing their new leader.

286
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:17,490
泰特的血脉有机会得以延续
And the chance to continue Tait's bloodline.

287
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:33,860
六个月后
Six months later,

288
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:38,000
隐秘的森林深处
hidden away in a secluded part of the forest,

289
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,260
七条小幼崽现身了
a litter of seven tiny puppies.

290
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:54,170
它们的母亲塔米是泰特最小的女儿
They're born to Tammy, Tait's youngest daughter,

291
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:58,160
现在是泰特王位的继承者
and now heir to Tait's throne.

292
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:05,450
新生命的到来以及新来的雄性杂色狼的加入
With these new arrivals, and the new males,

293
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:10,570
使得泰特原来的族群恢复到了二十三个成员
Tait's old pack has bounced back to 23 members.

294
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,720
塔米现在率领的族群
Tammy now leads a pack that is once again

295
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,960
再一次成为一股不能被忽视的力量
a force to be reckoned with.

296
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,240
而在西面  冲突早已成为历史
Back in the west, with the conflict long over,

297
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:39,040
黑蒂自己也产下十只健康的幼崽
Blacktip has produced 10 healthy puppies of her own.

298
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:52,470
泰特王朝终于重新归于平衡
Balance has finally been restored to Tait's dynasty.

299
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:04,170
全世界仅存六千六百只杂色狼
There are only 6,600 painted wolves left in the world.

300
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:10,330
截止目前我们记录了
To date, we count 280 descendants

301
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:12,450
两百八十只具有泰特的血脉
from Tait's bloodline.

302
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,800
泰特对这个种群的存续
Tait's contribution to the survival
